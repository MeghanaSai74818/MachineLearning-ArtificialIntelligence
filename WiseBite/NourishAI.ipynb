They will become familiar with the elements of the Food Pyramid and how to interpret it. Through a journaling activity, the students will track their own eating habits and learn how to evaluate it’s nutritional contents. They will learn how the components of the food they eat function in their bodies. They will learn how to evaluate food labeling in order to make informed decisions when purchasing food. Through a shopping exercise, the students will practice applying their nutritional knowledge to an authentic activity.\\n\\nThe lessons in this unit are designed to create relevancy to the multicultural makeup of the student population. Students will be able to utilize knowledge from their own cultural background while participating in the activities. The activities create opportunities for individual work as well as small group and large group interaction. Students have an opportunity to work with their families at home on several projects where they can apply what they have learned in their daily lives.\\n\\nGoals: Content – Students will gain knowledge pertaining to nutrition and skills to apply the knowledge to their everyday lives.\\n\\nLanguage – Students will communicate in social and academic situations as they are introduced to the concept of nutrition.\\n\\nLearning Strategies – Students will use songs, games, and an Internet activity to enhance learning within the content area. They will also be involved in creating visual aids to make the material more relevant and enrich their learning experience. By planning a meal using the Food Pyramid and a budget, students will integrate nutritional knowledge and math skills to produce a realistic meal plan.\\n\\nContext: Grade Level: 9-10th grade Type of class: Regular classroom instruction in a high school health class Native Language: Varied English Proficiency Levels: Varied\\n\\n3\\n\\nHow does Nutrition Apply to Me? Lesson 1\\n\\nLesson Objectives: Students will gain knowledge, which will assist them in being able to define nutrition and identify how it applies to their lives.\\n\\nStandards Goal 1 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 2 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 3 – 1, 3\\n\\nMaterials Needed: One copy of “My guide to nutrition” and the ”Student Self-Evaluation”** needs to be provided for each student.\\n\\nBellringer:\\n\\n1. Write the following words on the board or overhead projector: diet, nutrient, (RDA) Recommended Dietary Allowance, The Food Pyramid, calorie, fat, protein, carbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals.\\n\\n2. Ask students to brainstorm about what the words mean and how they might apply\\n\\nto the word nutrition.\\n\\nProcedures:\\n\\n1. Students will take the Student Self-Evaluation to assess their own personal\\n\\nknowledge of nutrition and health.\\n\\n2. Introduce concepts, which encompass the role of nutrition in their everyday lives.\\n\\nDefinition of nutrition • Why does one eat? • Nutrition throughout one’s life.\\n\\n3. The information can be presented in lecture format in which the students take\\n\\nnotes using “My guide to nutrition.” The lecture and discussion should include references to prior knowledge from the bellringer as well and the self-evaluation to establish relevance to the information being presented.\\n\\n4. An alternative to step 3: Create a handout with the information, which could be\\n\\nread as a class and discussed.\\n\\nEvaluation: Students will be asked to establish goals for themselves based on their self-evaluation results and the knowledge they have gained from the lesson.\\n\\nrefer to ESL standards document ** Student Self-Evaluation is located in the appendix\\n\\n4\\n\\n“My Guide to Nutrition”\\n\\n1. What is nutrition?\\n\\n2. What is a nutrient?\\n\\n3. What role does physical health play into nutrition?\\n\\n4. What role does Culture play into nutrition?\\n\\n5. What role does one’s environment play into nutrition?\\n\\n6. What role does one’s emotion play into nutrition?\\n\\n7. During your life when is nutrition important?\\n\\n8. Is nutrition important to teenagers? Why or Why not?\\n\\n9. How has your culture and family influenced your food habits?\\n\\n10.\\n\\nCompare your food habits with those of a friend. Give a few reasons why there\\n\\nmight be differences in habits.\\n\\n5\\n\\n“My Guide to Nutrition” Teacher edition\\n\\n1. What is nutrition? The science of looking at how the body uses nutrients and at\\n\\nhow and why people eat.\\n\\n2. What is a nutrient? Substances in food that the body needs to function properly.\\n\\n3. What role does physical health play into nutrition? Eating the right amounts and kinds of foods gives energy and stamina for active life-styles. A nutritious diet provides for growth and maintenance of a healthy body and helps keep you mentally alert.\\n\\n4. What role does Culture play into nutrition? Your food choices reflect the\\n\\nculture you live in, as well as your ethnic background and perhaps your religious beliefs. Teenagers have a culture of their own, too.\\n\\n5. What role does one’s environment play into nutrition? Your food choices are\\n\\nlinked to many factors. Your cultural heritage, your family and social relationships, media messages, and life-style all influence the foods you like and choose.\\n\\n6. What role does one’s emotion play into nutrition? Eating is closely tied to emotions. Eating to relieve tension or boredom can result in overeating. However, if you lose your appetite when you are upset or bored, you may miss out on getting essential nutrients. By understanding how eating relates to emotions, you can make more healthful food choices.\\n\\n7. During your life when is nutrition important? At every stage in life, good\\n\\nnutrition is essential for health.\\n\\n8. Is nutrition important to teenagers? Why or Why not? Nutrition is important to teenagers because adolescence is the period of the fastest and most growth you will experience. Adolescence is also a time when your life-style is probably a very active one. Good nutrition is important to both your growth and the energy you need to maintain an active life-style.\\n\\n9. How has your culture and family influenced your food habits?\\n\\nCompare your food habits with those of a friend. Give a few reasons why\\n\\n10. there might be differences in habits.\\n\\n6\\n\\nThe Food Pyramid Lesson 2\\n\\nLesson Objectives: Students will learn be able to identify The Food Pyramid and apply knowledge gained to their life and diet. Students will identify names, correct portions, food types and basic nutrients for each food group in the food pyramid.\\n\\nStandards Goal 1 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 2 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 3 – 1, 2, 3\\n\\nMaterials Needed: Each student will need one copy of the Pyramid Bingo grid, and The Food Pyramid. Teachers will need to make an over-head of the information given on the pyramid and daily requirements. One copy of The Pyramid Quiz is needed for each student. All materials for “Name that Food” are needed as well.\\n\\nProcedures:\\n\\n1. As an introduction activity give students a copy of The Food Pyramid, and the\\n\\nPyramid Bingo grid. Have students play the bingo game to introduce themselves to all the different levels and parts of the pyramid.\\n\\n2. Go over with an over-head projector the information given on The Food Pyramid. When students seem comfortable with the information and have had a chance to review a couple of days, administer The Food Pyramid Quiz.\\n\\n3. As a multi-culture activity give students an opportunity to discuss how The Food\\n\\nPyramid recommendations are different than those of their native country. 4. For the follow-up activity before the next lesson, have students play the game,\\n\\n“Name that Food.”\\n\\n5. An alternative activity with the Internet, have students research food pyramids of\\n\\ntheir native countries and compare with the American Food Pyramid.\\n\\nEvaluation: Students will pass The Food Pyramid Quiz with an 80% or better. From the game, “Name that Food” students will demonstrate knowledge of different types of food and where they would fit on The Pyramid.\\n\\nrefer to ESL standards document\\n\\n7\\n\\nFood Pyramid\\n\\nThe Food Pyramid from U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health\\n\\n8\\n\\nThe Food Pyramid Quiz\\n\\nFill in the Pyramid correctly with the five food groups and the correct amount of servings you need from each group for one day.

Students will fill in the boxes with words and phrases from The Food Pyramid.\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\nFood Guide Pyramid\\n\\nWhat is the Food Guide Pyramid?\\n\\nThe Food Guide Pyramid is a graphic guide of what to eat each day. It will help people follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The Food Guide Pyramid was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Dietary Guidelines provide advice for better health. Following the Dietary Guidelines can help reduce your chances of developing certain diseases. The guidelines are designed for healthy Americans aged 2 and up.\\n\\nHow is this guide different from the guides I have used in the past?\\n\\nThe Food Guide Pyramid is a new graphic to help people think about healthy eating. The recommended number of servings for some of the food groups is different on the Pyramid than the recommendations found on other food guides, such as the \"Basic Four.\" The Pyramid is designed to help people get the nutrients they need and avoid too much fat or sugar.\\n\\nWhy should I use the Food Guide Pyramid?\\n\\nIt is based on current research about diet and health and was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Food Guide Pyramid should be used with students in place of the \"Basic Four\" or other food guides you may be using.\\n\\nWhat do the different pieces of the pyramid mean?\\n\\nThe Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes eating foods from the five major food groups shown in the pyramid\\'s three lower levels. None of these major food groups is more important than another - for good health, you need them all. Each of these food groups provides some, but not all, of the nutrients you need. Foods in one group can\\'t replace those in another. Fats, oils and sweets are at the Pyramid tip. People should use these sparingly.\\n\\nWhy is there a range of servings for each food group?\\n\\nThe number of servings people need depends on their age, sex, size, and activity level. For example, an active male teenager needs more servings than a less active, older woman. Almost everyone should have at least the lowest number of servings in each range. Preschool children need the same variety of foods but may need smaller servings. Be sure, however, that preschoolers eat or drink two full servings from the milk group daily.\\n\\nWhy are the recommended number of servings for the bread, fruit, and vegetable groups higher on this guide than on others I have used in the past?\\n\\nMost people need to eat more of these foods for the complex carbohydrates (starches), vitamins, minerals, and fiber they supply. Fruits, vegetables, and foods from the bread\\n\\n12\\n\\ngroup are low in fat, unless they are prepared with added fat as are French fries, doughnuts, or croissants.\\n\\nCookies, cakes, and doughnuts are made with flour. Does that mean they are part of the breads, cereals, rice and pasta group?\\n\\nYes. Foods such as cookies, cakes and doughnuts are part of this group. However, they are high in fat and sugars and people should eat them only occasionally.\\n\\nWhy are the symbols for fat (a round dot) and added sugar (a triangle) at the Pyramid tip but also throughout the Pyramid?\\n\\nFat and added sugar is found in many types of food and in most of the food groups. Fat and added sugars are shown mainly in foods from the pyramid tip (fats, oils, and sweets). But symbols are shown in all food groups as a reminder that some choices in these groups can be high in fat or added sugar. You need to select wisely from within each food group.\\n\\nFood Guide Pyramid - A Guide to Daily Food Choices\\n\\nBread, Cereal, Rice and Pasta Group (6-11 servings) This group includes foods from grains. You need the most servings of these foods each day since they provide the base of the pyramid. These foods provide complex carbohydrates (starches), which are an important source of energy, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. What counts as a serving? 1 slice of bread, 11 ounce of ready to eat cereal, and 1/2 cup of cooked cereal, rice, or pasta.\\n\\nVegetable Group (3-5 servings) Vegetables provide vitamins, such as vitamins A and C, and folate, and minerals, such as iron and magnesium. They are naturally low in fat and also provide fiber. What counts as 1 serving? 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 1/2 cup of other vegetables - cooked or chopped raw; 3/4 cup of vegetable juice.\\n\\nFruit Group Fruits and fruit juices provide important amounts of vitamin A and C and potassium. They are low in fat and sodium. What counts as a serving? A medium apple, banana, or orange; 1/2 cup of chopped, cooked or canned fruit; 3/4 cup of fruit juice.\\n\\nMeat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, and Nuts (2-3 servings) Meat, poultry, and fish supply protein, B vitamins, iron, and zinc. Dry beans, eggs, and nuts are similar to meats in providing protein and most vitamins and minerals. What counts as a serving? 2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish; 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, 1 egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter (count as 1 ounce of meat). The total amount of these servings should be the equivalent of 5 to 7 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day.\\n\\nMilk, Yogurt, and Cheese (2-3 servings) Milk products provide protein, vitamins, and minerals. Milk, yogurt, and cheese are the best sources of calcium. What counts as a serving? 1 cup of milk or yogurt; 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese; 2 ounces of process cheese, Two servings for most people and servings for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, teenagers, and young adults to age 24.\\n\\n13\\n\\nFats, Oils, Sweets (use sparingly) It is recommended that Americans limit fat in their diets to 30 percent of calories. This amounts to 53 grams of fat in a 1600 calorie diet, 73 grams of fat in a 2200 calorie diet, and 93 grams of fat in a 2800 calorie diet. All food groups contain low fat choices. Choosing a diet low in sugar is important for people who have low calorie needs. Sugars include white sugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, corn syrup, honey, and molasses; these supply calories and few other nutrients. Sugar might be added to foods in the groups, but other foods, which are high in sugar, are candy, soft drinks, jams, and jellies.\\n\\nHow Many Servings is Right for Me? The pyramid shows a range of servings for each food group. The number of servings that are right for you depends on how many calories you need, which in turn depends on your age, sex, size, and how active you are. Almost everyone should have at least the lowest number of servings in the ranges.\\n\\nFor Young Children Preschool children need the same variety of foods as older family members do, but may need fewer calories. The can eat smaller servings which will be less calories, but they should have at least 2 cups of milk per day.\\n\\nCombination foods For mixed foods, do the best you can to estimate the food group servings. For example, a slice of pizza has servings from the bread group (crust), milk group (cheese) and vegetable group (tomato).\\n\\nDietary Guidelines\\n\\nThe United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) established the dietary guidelines. They are intended for people who are healthy and may not apply to special needs diets or conditions. Good health depends upon many things, including heredity, lifestyle, personality traits, mental health, attitudes, and environment. Food alone cannot make you healthy, or guarantee well being. Good eating habits that are based upon the seven guidelines and exercise can help keep you healthy and improve your health.\\n\\nThe dietary guidelines are:\\n\\n1. Eat a Variety of Foods:\\n\\n1. Our bodies need approximately 40 different nutrients. Nutrients are found\\n\\nin the foods a person eats.\\n\\n2. No single food item supplies all the nutrients needed by the human body. 3. The greater the variety of food we eat, the less chance we have of\\n\\ndeveloping a deficiency or excess of any single nutrient.\\n\\n4. Foods should be selected according to the food pyramid guidelines to\\n\\nassure a variety of food and a well-balanced diet.\\n\\n2. Maintain a Healthy Weight:\\n\\n1. Many diseases and disorders are associated with obesity.\\n\\n1. high blood pressure\\n\\n14\\n\\n2. increased levels of blood fats and cholesterol 3. diabetes in older people 4. heart attacks 5. strokes\\n\\n2. The desirable weight for each person is different, depending upon frame\\n\\nsize and build. Do not compare yourself to others.\\n\\n3. Improved eating habits help one maintain a healthy weight.\\n\\n1. Eat slowly. 2. Prepare smaller portions of food. 3. Eat when hungry, allowing 10-20 minutes after eating before\\n\\ntaking more food. This allows your body to deciding if you are really hungry.\\n\\n4. Increase everyday physical activities. 5. Do not attempt to decrease weight below your acceptable range. Do no\\n\\nattempt to lose weight until you are an adult or your growth is complete. Children who are obese can grow into their weight by regularly exercising and avoiding or limiting choices from the fats, oils, and sweets group. Children should not try to lose weight unless they are under close medical direction.\\n\\n3. Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.\\n\\n1. Avoid too much fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. (The backs of the Dairy Council Comparison Cards illustrate the amount of fat contained in each food. It is a graphic and easy way for students to understand this concept.) 1. Choose lean meat, fish, poultry, dry beans and peas as protein\\n\\nsources. Lean meats do not leave much fat in a pan when they are cooked.\\n\\n2. Moderate your use of eggs and organ meats, such as liver. 3. Limit your intake of butter, cream, hydrogenated margarine,\\n\\nshortenings, palm and coconut oil, and foods made from such products.\\n\\n4. Trim excess fat off meats; take skin off of poultry before cooking, and rinse hamburger in hot water after cooking to reduce fat content.\\n\\n5. Broil, bake, or boil rather than fry when cooking foods. Use fat- free sprays in pans when baking rather than oil or shortening. 6. Read labels carefully to determine both amount and types of fat\\n\\ncontained in foods. (Animal fats are usually higher in saturated fats than vegetable oils. The exceptions are coconut oil which is 86 percent saturated, palm kernel oil is 81 percent, beef fat is 50 percent, cottonseed is 26 percent, other vegetables oils are less than 20 percent saturated.)\\n\\n2. Avoiding high fat intake will decrease the chance of heart attack and limit nutrient-poor calorie intake. Diets low in fat and cholesterol are factors that we can control when trying t avoid the risks of heart disease. 3. These guidelines are not to prohibit the use of any specific food item.\\n\\nModeration is the key.\\n\\nAssignment: Students are given an allowance of 10 grams of fat for an after school snack. How much snack can you get for your fat? (Using the backs of the Diary Council Comparison Cards will make this activity more fun for the students.)\\n\\n15\\n\\n4. Choose a diet with plenty of vegetables, fruits, and grain products - Refer to pyramid and compare numbers and sizes of servings for these food groups. Point out that the ingredient list on breads must say \\'whole wheat flour\\' if you want to increase your fiber intake. \"Wheat bread\" often has coloring, not whole wheat, added to the white bread recipe.\\n\\n1. These foods are a major source of energy in the average diet. 2. Carbohydrates contain less than half the number of calories per gram than\\n\\nfat does.\\n\\n3. Complex carbohydrate foods, such as breads, cereals, pasta, rice, dry\\n\\nbeans, dry peas, and other vegetables such as potatoes and corn, contain many essential nutrients.\\n\\n4. These foods increase dietary fiber.\\n\\n5. Use sugars only in moderation.\\n\\n1. It is estimated that every American uses more than 130 pounds of sugar and sweeteners each year (about 3/4 cup of sugar each day). Too much sugar is undesirable because it provides calories without nutrients so you either do not get all the nutrients you need or you have to eat more calories than you need to get adequate nutrition. Students are amazed to see the actual amount of sugar contained in foods. You may wish to take a bowl of sugar, a glass test tube and measuring spoons and demonstrate how much sugar is contained in some foods they eat. For example: Tell the class that a can of 7-Up contains 9 teaspoons of sugar. Then measure out nine teaspoons of sugar into the test tube for them to see how much sugar they are drinking when then drink 7-Up. If you eat meals or snacks with a lot of sugar in them, you soon feel hungry again. You get a quick burst of energy, which fizzles out quickly. Foods without a lot of sugar in them keep you feeling full longer.\\n\\n2. Health hazards from eating too much sugar include tooth decay and\\n\\nweight gain.\\n\\n3. People should read labels to discover the types and amounts of sugar in a\\n\\nproduct. Ask students these multiple-choice questions. 1. How much sugar is in 12 ounces of 7-Up?\\n\\n1. 9 tsp. 2. 3 tsp. 3. 1 tsp. 4. 30 tsp.\\n\\n2. How much sugar is in 1/2 cup of Jello?\\n\\n1. 6 tsp. 2. 2 tsp. 3. 3 tsp. 4. 4 1/2 tsp.\\n\\n3. How much sugar is in a glazed donut?\\n\\n1. 3 tsp. 2. 4 Tbs. 3. 6 tsp. 4. 1 tsp.\\n\\n4. How much sugar is in one large marshmallow?\\n\\n1. 1 1/2 tsp. 2. 3 tsp. 3. 1/2 tsp. 4. 4 tsp.\\n\\n16\\n\\n5. Which of the following contains 3 teaspoons of sugar? (Answer is:\\n\\nall)\\n\\n1. 1 Tbs brown sugar 2. 1 Tbs corn syrup 3. 1 Tbs granulated sugar 4. 1 Tbs honey\\n\\n4. Some tips for avoiding excessive sugar:\\n\\n1. Use less sugar in all its forms. What are some of the names for\\n\\nsugar? Sucrose is a simple sugar (draw one link of a chain on the board). Fructose is the sugar in fruit, (draw 2 links of a chain joined together). Lactose is the sugar in milk (Three circles hooded together). Maltose is the sugar from grains such as corn syrup, brown sugar; molasses, etc. (make a more complicated chain model). Simple sugars are broken down and digested very quickly. Complex carbohydrates take longer to break down and digest. Therefore, if you eat a high sugar content cereal for breakfast, you will be hungry more quickly than if you eat a cereal with complex carbohydrates. If you add one teaspoon (5 grams) of sugar to cereal, you have increased the simple carbohydrates, but you have not subtracted any of the complex carbohydrates. I you add a banana, rather than sugar, you are adding more complex carbohydrates.\\n\\n2. Eat fewer foods containing sugars, such as candy, soft drinks, ice\\n\\ncream, cakes, and cookies.\\n\\n3. Eat more fresh fruits.\\n\\n5. How often you eat sugar is as important as how much sugar you eat in\\n\\nrelation to tooth decay.\\n\\n6. Use salt and sodium only in moderation. Salt is made from sodium and\\n\\nchloride. They are essential elements in limited amounts.\\n\\n1. Sodium is present in many beverages and foods we eat. One teaspoon of salt contains 2000 milligrams of sodium. A safe and adequate amount is 1000-3000 milligrams each day. We can get that much sodium without adding salt to anything.\\n\\n2. Americans consume much more sodium than their bodies require. (Some\\n\\npeople consume 10 times as much sodium as they need daily.) 3. High blood pressure is a major health risk of excessive sodium use. 4. Ways to reduce sodium intake include:\\n\\n1. Use less table salt. 2. Eat foods high in sodium only in moderation (potato chips,\\n\\npretzels, salted nuts, cheese, pickled foods, and cured meats).\\n\\n3. Learn to enjoy unsalted, natural flavors of food. 4. Read food labels carefully to determine amounts of sodium\\n\\npresent. Monosodiumglutimate (MSG), backing soda, garlic salt, and onion salt, soy sauce, bullion, medications, etc., also contains large amounts of sodium. 7. If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.\\n\\nThis guideline is written for people over 21 years of age. Depending upon how much this topic is covered in other classes taught at your school, this may be a good time to discuss the serious problems related to drinking alcoholic beverages. High school students should not be drinking alcoholic beverages - it is against the law.\\n\\n17\\n\\nUsing the Food Guide Pyramid\\n\\nThe suggested numbers of servings to eat daily from each food group and what counts as a serving are listed below. Use this guide to help you make decisions on healthy food choices.\\n\\nFood Groups\\n\\nSuggested Daily Servings\\n\\nFats, Oils, and Sweets\\n\\nMilk, Yogurt , and Cheese\\n\\nUse sparingly. Go easy on fats (butter, salad dressings, margarine, oils, and gravy) and sugars (candy, soft drinks, syrups, and jellies). Use less fat and sugar in cooking and at the table.\\n\\n2 to 3 servings (at least 3 servings for teens and adults through age 24, and for pregnant and breast feeding women); two servings for everyone else.\\n\\nMeat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, and Nuts\\n\\n2 to 3 servings\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n3 to 5 servings\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n2 to 4 servings\\n\\n18\\n\\nWhat Counts as One Serving?\\n\\n1 cup of milk or\\n\\nyogurt\\n\\n1 1/2 to 2 ounces of\\n\\nnatural cheese (such as cheddar)\\n\\n2 ounces of process cheese (such as American)\\n\\n2 to 3 ounces of\\n\\ncooked lean meat, poultry or fish • Count 1/2 cup of\\n\\ncooked dry beans, 1 egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter as 1 ounce of meat (about 1/3 serving).\\n\\n1 cup of raw, leafy\\n\\nvegetables • 1/2 cup of other\\n\\nvegetables, cooked or raw\\n\\n3/4 cup of vegetable\\n\\njuice\\n\\n1 medium apple,\\n\\nbanana, orange, or other whole fruit • 1/2 cup of chopped, cooked, or canned fruit\\n\\n3/4 cup of fruit juice\\n\\n(only 100 percent fruit juice can be counted as fruit).\\n\\nBread, Cereal, Rich, and Pasta\\n\\n6 to 11 servings (include foods made from whole grains).\\n\\nas fruit).\\n\\n1/4 cup of dried fruit\\n\\n1 slice of bread or 1\\n\\ntortilla\\n\\n1 ounce of read-to-eat\\n\\ncereal\\n\\n1/2 cup of cooked\\n\\ncereal, rice, or pasta\\n\\n1/2 of a medium\\n\\ndoughnut or croissant\\n\\n1/2 of a hamburger\\n\\nbun, bagel, or English muffin\\n\\n19\\n\\nName that Food! Food Pyramid game and activity\\n\\nPurpose: Students will be able to classify different food items into the correct categories of the Food Pyramid, identify foods that keep our bodies healthy, and create a Food Pyramid booklet.\\n\\nMaterials Needed:\\n\\n1. Construction Paper 2. Notebook Paper 3. Magazines or Newspapers 4. Ribbon 5. Scissors 6. Glue 7. Overhead Picture of the Food Pyramid\\n\\nProcedure:\\n\\n1. Display a variety of foods on a table. Display an overhead picture of the Food Pyramid.\\n\\n2. Review with students the different levels of the Food Pyramid and the daily servings we need from each group to keep our bodies healthy.\\n\\n3. Show the students an example of the booklet they will be making. Explain the following procedures:\\n\\n1. Choose two pieces of construction paper, and six sheets of notebook paper. 2. Place the notebook paper between the sheets of construction paper. Punch 3 holes\\n\\nalong the left edge. Tie pieces of ribbon through the holes.\\n\\n3. On each page, write the name of a Food Pyramid section, and the number of servings suggested. Glue the appropriate pictures of food items, cut from magazines or newspapers, to the pages of your booklet.\\n\\n4. Decorate the cover of your Food Pyramid booklet!\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n\\nHold up each of the food items displayed on the front table. Ask the students to identify its place on the Food Pyramid.\\n\\nEach of the students will work independently to cut out food pictures from magazines and newspapers, and construct a Food Pyramid booklet.\\n\\nSummarize the information covered in the lesson, and play a game of Name That Food.\\n\\n20\\n\\nName That Food:\\n\\nDivide the class into several small teams. Each team will need a pencil and a piece of paper. The teacher selects a section from the Food Pyramid, and a letter of the alphabet. For example, foods from the bread and cereals group that start with the letter \"B.\" The students have one minute to record a list of foods. When the minute is up, each group reads their list. The teacher records the number of items on each group\\'s list, and another category and letter are selected. The game continues until all sections of the pyramid have been covered. The group with the highest score wins the game!\\n\\n21\\n\\nThe Food You Eat Lesson 3 and 6\\n\\nLesson Objective: To keep a food journal for a 3-day period to see if nutritional requirements are met on a regular basis.\\n\\nMaterials:\\n\\nJournal\\n\\nStudent Sheets • • Computers with Internet access • Article “Stock Up Before You Leave”\\n\\nStandards Goal 1 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 2 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 3 – 1, 2, 3\\n\\nPre-Lesson Instructions:\\n\\nThis lesson involves students keeping a food journal over a 3-day period. This lesson may work best if assigned on a Thursday or Friday so that students can keep their journals over the weekend.\\n\\nAfter the students have recorded their food intake for 3 days, they will need to use a computer with Internet access to find more information about the foods they have eaten. Reserve time in the computer lab for this part of the activity. Remind students of your school’s Internet usage policy.\\n\\nBackground Information:\\n\\nTo help monitor general food intake while in orbit, astronauts fill out a food frequency questionnaire. This is like a journal or food diary where crew members record how many items they have eaten each week. Foods are grouped by categories such as beverages, poultry, and snacks. This information is shared with the mission’s flight surgeon and other nutritionists. This questionnaire gives a basic indication of caloric and nutritional intake by each crew member. In special cases where exact food consumption data is required for a scientific experiment, the astronauts would use a bar code reader and scan the bar code on each package of food consumed. This data is then transferred to the researchers on the ground. This procedure is more time consuming and is, therefore, only done when scientifically required.\\n\\nIn this lesson, students will keep their own food journals to see if they are meeting the requirements for calories, iron, calcium, and vitamin C consumption.\\n\\nProcedure:\\n\\n22\\n\\nDay 1 – Introducing the Lesson\\n\\n1. Read the NASA explorer’s article, “Stock up before You Leave!” Discuss the\\n\\narticle as a class, and answer any questions the students may have.\\n\\n2. Discuss the importance of eating healthy. Ask the students if they think they eat\\n\\nwhat their bodies need on a regular basis.\\n\\n3. Explain that the class will be completing food journals to see if they are indeed eating what they should to meet some of the requirements their bodies need. This journal will be similar to the one kept by astronauts when they are staying on the International Space Station.\\n\\n4. Hand out the Student Sheets. Go over the instructions as a class. Answer any\\n\\nquestions the students may have.\\n\\n5. Explain that the class will be keeping a journal of all of the food they eat for the next 3 days. This information will be kept in a table the students will create in their journals. There is an example of a possible table design on the Student Sheets.\\n\\n6. Remind students that they need only keep track of the foods and the amounts\\n\\nthey eat. The rest of the table will be filled in during class time in the computer lab.\\n\\n7. Allow 3 days for the students to collect their data in their journals.\\n\\nSeveral Days Later – After completing the Food Pyramid and Nutrients Lessons\\n\\n8. When all students have completed their journals, spend a class period in the\\n\\ncomputer lab so that students may find out the information needed to complete the rest of the food journal table. The Web site needed for this research is listed on the Student Sheet and in the Related Links section of the Teacher Sheets. 9. Once the students have completed their tables and added up the food intake\\n\\namounts for each day, return to the classroom.\\n\\nDiscussion/Wrap-up:\\n\\nDiscuss the students’ findings as a class. Answer the following questions in\\n\\ndiscussion, or have students answer them in their science journals.\\n\\no How did your calorie consumption each day compare to the required\\n\\nvalues for your age group? Did this surprise you?\\n\\no Do you get enough of the vitamins and minerals studied in this lesson?\\n\\no\\n\\nDoes that surprise you? If someone doesn’t get enough calcium, what could they add to their diet to help them reach the required amount? What about iron? Vitamin C?\\n\\no What can you do to improve your diet?\\n\\nExtensions:\\n\\nLook at typical meal deals at fast food restaurants to see if they could be considered “healthy meals.”\\n\\nHave students devise healthy menus for kids their age.\\n\\n23\\n\\nrefer to ESL standards document\\n\\nThe Food You Eat – Student Sheet\\n\\nYour assignment is to keep track of everything that you eat for the next 3 days. After you have completed your food journal, you will analyze the data to see if you have eaten foods that help you meet the required amounts of calories, calcium, iron, and vitamin C.\\n\\nFollow the steps below. In your journal, make a chart like the one below. You will need one of these charts for each day you are keeping track of your food intake. The apple and milk are examples of the data you will be recording.\\n\\nFood (amount)\\n\\nCalories\\n\\nA m o u n t Calcium (%)\\n\\no f\\n\\nAmount of Iron (%)\\n\\nA m o u n t Vitamin C (%)\\n\\no f\\n\\nApple slices (1 cup)\\n\\n65\\n\\n2% Milk (1.5 cups)\\n\\n207\\n\\n1\\n\\n53\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n10\\n\\n8\\n\\n2. During the 3 days of data collection, write down just the foods and amounts in the first column for each day.\\n\\n3. After the 3 days, bring the food journal to class with you. Go to the computer lab, and find the information needed to fill in the rest of the chart. The following Web site will be helpful. Note that fast food restaurants are listed down the right side of the page for quick reference. http://www.nutritiondata.com/\\n\\n4. Now that you have all of the needed information, total up the data in each column. You should have the total number of calories consumed each day, and the percentages of the recommended intakes for calcium, iron, and vitamin C.\\n\\n5. The recommended calories per day for males age 11-14 are 2,500 and for females age 11-24 is 2,200. How did your daily calorie consumption compare?\\n\\n6. Did you get the recommended amount of calcium, iron, and vitamin C each day? What can you do to better reach these nutritional goals?\\n\\n24\\n\\nStock Up Before You Leave!\\n\\nAstronauts cannot make a quick trip to the grocery store while they are orbiting several hundred miles above Earth, nor can they cruise by a drive-through restaurant. They need to stock up in advance with the food they will need for their trip. Fortunately for crew members, the pantry is well-stocked during missions. Since the American and Russian astronauts share living space aboard the International Space Station (ISS), each sponsoring country provides half of the food supply.\\n\\nFood provided by the Russian Space Agency is generally preserved in cans; American rations are typically freeze-dried or thermostabilized, and packaged in flexible foil or plastic pouches. Both methods of preservation are shelf stable, which is important, since there are not food refrigerators or freezers on the Space Station. There are small chillers for food use, but they are only about the size of a school locker.\\n\\nAmerican entrees such as steak, chicken teriyaki, and scrambled eggs are joined by Russian rations including chicken and rice, fish, and ham. Because of the diversity of the crew, ISS menu planners work hard to offer foods which give crew members a taste of home. A future goal is to include foods from the other international partners in the ISS menu. However different, both American and Russian menus feature an assortment of fruits, vegetables, and snacks to fill a revolving schedule of different meals-currently a 10-day menu cycle. When a menu rotation is complete, the cycle starts again. With a steady stockpile of canned and dried foods, there is always plenty to eat, but boredom may affect the way crew members enjoy their meals.\\n\\nSince the ISS was first inhabited, over 10,000 meals have been eaten, and over 6,804 kilograms (15,000 pounds) of food have been sent to keep the residents healthy. In a 180- day mission (6 months), given a 10-day rotating menu, the same meals will be served 18 times-and that is why nutritionists and astronauts take great care when planning the foods that are sent into space; nobody wants to be bored with their dinner. To add a change of pace to daily meals, astronauts receive small quantities of extra food items when a Space Shuttle visits the ISS or when the Russian Progress re-supply space ships docking with the ISS. These deliveries might include fresh fruit, candy, and cookies. The fresh items will last for only a short time without refrigeration, but serve as a wonderful change of pace to the processed shelf stable food.\\n\\nAmerican food stored on the ISS is prepared at the Space Food Systems Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The food is designed to stay fresh for 9 to 12 months. The food currently used in space has greatly improved since the first missions. The foods eaten now in space resemble many-though not all-foods that average Americans would find in the shelf-stable foods area of a grocery store. In the early 1960s, astronauts ate bite-sized cubes of gelatin-coated foods, freeze-dried powders, and semi- liquids squeezed from aluminum tubes. What an improvement!\\n\\nEven with the changes made over the years to space food, there will always be challenges to eating (and tasting) in orbit. Reduced gravity causes fluid shifts in the body. Fluids\\n\\n25\\n\\nnormally in the lower body shift to the upper extremities, leaving crew members feeling congested. This affects how food tastes, just like Earth-bound humans notice differences when they have a cold.\\n\\nTo compensate for reduced taste sensations, astronauts often season their food with hot sauce and ketchup to intensify the flavors.\\n\\nTo help monitor general food intake, astronauts fill out a food frequency questionnaire. This is like a journal or food diary where crew members record how many items they have eaten each week. Foods are grouped by categories such as beverages, poultry, and snacks, and this information is shared with the mission\\'s flight surgeon and other nutritionists. This questionnaire gives a basic indication of caloric and nutritional intake by each crewmember. In special cases where exact food consumption data is required for a scientific experiment, the astronauts would use a bar code reader and scan the bar code on each package of food consumed. This data would then be transferred to the researchers on the ground. This procedure is more time consuming and is, therefore, only done when scientifically required.\\n\\nRegardless of the cuisine, astronauts and menu planners work together to be sure the meals provide the proper balance of nutrition and calories. Astronauts exercise for more than 2 hours each day in space, and burn extra calories during fitness workouts. This is sometimes balanced, however, by lack of muscle exertion for daily activities. The crew members do not climb stairs, or even use arm muscles to pull open cabinets or slide out chairs. Therefore, astronauts must stay active to minimize bone loss.\\n\\nTo monitor nutrition and metabolism, blood and urine samples are taken before launch and after return to measure for proteins and hormones that reveal how well the body is processing various nutrients. Vitamin and mineral levels are determined, and bone, muscle, and organ response is recorded as well. These tests help scientists know if astronauts are obtaining too much, too little, or just the right amount of nutrients. Learning more about how bodies adapt to spaceflight is important as researchers work to prepare for flights to the Moon and Mars.\\n\\nAs the missions to the Moon and Mars proceed, space nutrition will change even more. Astronauts going to Mars may grow some of their own food onboard their space vehicles! Experiments have already shown that plants can be grown onboard the ISS, and they could furnish salad greens, fresh vegetables, and grains to be processed into flour-based products. From tubes of food, to shelf-stable packaging, to growing their own food, astronauts have adapted-and will continue to adapt-to the advances in technology and science that help them live healthy lives even while away from the Earth.\\n\\nCourtesy of NASA\\'s Biological and Physical Research Enterprise Published by NASAexplores: March 25, 2004\\n\\n26\\n\\nWhy Do We Really Need Food? Lesson 4\\n\\nTime Needed: Two to three 50-minute class periods.\\n\\nLesson Objectives: The student will develop an understanding of how the body utilizes the food that they eat. The student will learn the six nutrients their bodies need every day: proteins, fats, carbohydrates, water, vitamins, and minerals.\\n\\nStandards Goal 1 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 2 – 1, 2, 3 Goal 3 – 1, 2, 3\\n\\nProcedures: A. Bellringer 1. Prior to class write the following terms on the board: Kwashiorkor, Pellagra, Beriberi, Marasmus, Xeropthalmia 2. Ask students to write down the 5 words from the board into their notebooks. Tell them the words all have something in common and to write down what they think that might be. 3. After they have time to think and write, ask for volunteers to share their ideas. If they guess that they are all diseases caused by nutrient deficiencies, then try to elicit how they learned that, and if they know what deficiencies cause each disorder. If no one guesses, add scurvy, rickets, and anemia to the list. If they still can’t guess, then tell the students that they are all diseases caused by a lack of a critical nutrient that is normally supplied in a healthy diet.\\n\\nB. Presentation of Information on Nutrients 1. Introduce the six groups of nutrients required by the human body; proteins, fats, carbohydrates, water, vitamins, and minerals, through a brainstorming session. Ask students if they know what things the body requires. As students give their ideas, place them on a concept map. 2. Information can then be presented in lecture format in which the students take notes in their notebooks or using the note-taking guide handout. The lecture should include references to the prior knowledge that was organized into the concept map and questioning to elicit further prior knowledge or experiences that will aid in creating relevance to the information. Alternative for Step 2. Handouts could be created with the information, which could be read as a class and discussed.\\n\\nC. Evaluation Students will be asked to create an informational brochure or poster that describes a disease caused by a nutrient deficiency from one of the charts, including signs and\\n\\n27\\n\\nsymptoms, prevention, and treatment. A public health informational brochure or poster should be shown as a model.\\n\\nrefer to ESL standards document\\n\\nEssential Nutrients – Note Taking Guide\\n\\n1.

Proteins What are they? Chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks for all body tissues. The body needs 20 amino acids. The body can manufacture eleven of them, but the other nine, called essential amino acids, must come from food. Where do they come from? Animal sources of proteins such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs and milk contain all of the essential amino acids and are called complete proteins. Plant proteins are found in legumes (beans), nuts, and seeds. They are called incomplete proteins because they do not contain all of the essential amino acids. Some may be combined to form complete proteins, for example, rice and beans. How does the body use them? The body uses proteins mainly for building and maintaining all its tissues. Throughout life new proteins form constantly to replace damaged or worn-out body cells. What happens if we don’t get enough? Kwashiorkor is a condition resulting from inadequate protein intake. Early symptoms include fatigue, irritability, and lethargy. As protein deprivation continues, one sees growth failure, loss of muscle mass, generalized swelling (edema), and decreased immunity. A large, protuberant belly is common. The incidence of kwashiorkor in children in the U.S. is extremely small and it is typically found in countries where there is drought and famine. 2. Fats What are they? Fats are compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They come in several forms depending on how they are put together; saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and Trans fats. Where do they come from? Almost all of the food we eat contains some fat. It can be found in meats, milk and milk products like cheese, butter, and ice cream, vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, and foods that are fried or prepared with sauces. How does the body use them? Fat provides our most concentrated form of energy and is used to build our own body’s fats. In the body, fats carry vitamins in the bloodstream and builds cells. Body fat serves as a source of stored energy, cushions organs, and acts as insulation. Most of the fats our body needs can be made from carbohydrates, but there are three essential fatty acids that the body can’t make on its own. These need to come from foods that we eat. What happens if we don’t get enough? A deficiency of certain fats has been linked to neurological disorders such as ADD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression. 3. Carbohydrates What are they? Carbohydrates are molecules made up of carbon and water. They come in three forms: sugars, starches, and fiber.\\n\\n30\\n\\nWhere do they come from? Plants produce most carbohydrates How does the body use them? Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred source of energy.\\n\\nWhat happens if we don’t get enough? Without enough carbohydrates to maintain blood sugar levels, the body will attack its own protein. Eventually, the body enters a state of semi-starvation. This condition is known as marasmus . 4. Water What is it? A compound of hydrogen and oxygen that is liquid at temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius. An extraordinary property of water is its ability to dissolve other substances. Were it not for the solvent property of water, life could not exist because water transfers nutrients vital to life in animals and plants. Where does it come from? The most important source is drinking water. It is also in other fluids we drink. Fruits and vegetables have high water content. Most other foods contain some water. How does the body use it? Water is vital to every function in the body; about two-thirds of the body is water. It is the main component of blood and carries nutrients to your cells and carries away waste products. It also lubricates joints and mucous membranes, allows you to swallow and digest food, and regulates body temperature through perspiration. What happens if we don’t get enough? Dehydration is a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough water. Persistent fatigue, lethargy, muscle weakness or cramps, headaches, dizziness, nausea, forgetfulness, confusion, deep rapid breathing, or an increased heart rate characterizes dehydration. Dehydration is a very serious; it can quickly cause severe problems and even death.\\n\\n31\\n\\nVitamins\\n\\nVitamins are known as micronutients because they are only required in small amounts. They work with enzymes in the body by triggering chemical reactions that allow the digestion, absorption, metabolism and use of other nutrients. Vitamins are classified into two groups; water-soluble and fat-soluble.\\n\\nWater-Soluble Vitamins: Water soluble vitamins are vitamins that dissolve in water. They are not stored in your body, so they must be eaten every day. Excess amounts are not usually a problem because they are excreted.\\n\\nVitamin\\n\\nRole in Body\\n\\nFood Source\\n\\nC (ascorbic acid)\\n\\nB1 (thiamine)\\n\\nB2 (riboflavin)\\n\\nNiacin\\n\\nB6\\n\\nProtects against infection; helps with formation of connective tissue; helps wounds heal; maintains elasticity and strength of blood vessels; acts as glue to hold cells together Changes glucose into energy or fat; helps prevent nervous irritability; necessary for good appetite\\n\\nTransports hydrogen; essential in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins; helps keep skin in healthy condition\\n\\nMaintenance of body tissues; energy production; needed to utilize carbohydrates, to synthesize human fat, and for tissue respiration Essential to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism\\n\\nPantothenic acid\\n\\nFunctions in the breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins; necessary for synthesis of some hormones\\n\\nFolic acid (folacin)\\n\\nNecessary for the production of RNA and DNA and normal red blood cells\\n\\nB12\\n\\nNeeded for production of red blood cells and for normal growth\\n\\nCitrus fruits, tomatoes, cabbage, broccoli, potatoes, peppers\\n\\nWhole-grain or enriched cereals, liver, yeast, nuts, legumes, wheat germ Liver, green leafy vegetables, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, whole grain or enriched cereals Yeast, liver, wheat germ, kidney, eggs, fish\\n\\nYeast, wheat bran and germ, liver, kidneys, meat, whole grains, fish, vegetables Liver, kidney, milk, yeast, wheat germ, whole grain cereals and breads, green vegetables Liver, nuts, orange juice, green leafy vegetable ( but destroyed by cooking) Meat, liver, eggs, milk\\n\\n32\\n\\nWhat happens if you don’t get enough?

The body is able to store fat-soluble vitamins in fatty tissue. Ingesting fat-soluble vitamins in larger than necessary amounts can cause a build-up to toxic levels.\\n\\nVitamin Role in Body A\\n\\nFormation of visual pigments for eyesight Helps keep skin soft\\n\\nFood Source Green or yellow vegetables, milk products, liver\\n\\nD\\n\\nE\\n\\nK\\n\\nEssential for normal bone and tooth development, increases calcium absorption Maintenance of red blood cells, Synthesis of blood clotting factors\\n\\nSynthesized when skin is exposed to sunlight, fish oils, milk products\\n\\nGreen leafy vegetables Green leafy vegetables, synthesized by intestinal bacteria\\n\\nDeficiency Xeropthalmia – drying of the cornea Night-blindness, dry, flaky skin\\n\\nRickets -Defective bone formation\\n\\nExcess Toxic in large doses, increase in bone fractures, birth defects (polar bear liver contains toxic amounts for humans) Excessive calcium deposits and mental retardation in children\\n\\nanemia\\n\\nHemorrhagic disease in newborns, slow clotting of blood\\n\\nHigh doses may be toxic to infants High doses may be toxic in infants\\n\\nMinerals\\n\\nMinerals are inorganic substances that are needed to carry out many processes in the body.

Copy the clues and cut them out. Give each student one of the clues. Let students take turns reading the clue. They then give the correct answer or a bluff answer. For example: The student\\'s clue is \"I help keep your skin soft\". The student may answer \"protein\" (the correct answer is Vitamin A). If the rest of the students agree, they raise their hands, if they disagree, they leave their hands down. Being able to give bluff answers eliminates embarrassment for the students that do not know the correct answers. It also challenges the thinking of the other students.\\n\\n1.

For more advanced groups the “families” can include a vegetarian, cultural or religious dietary restrictions, a member with a food allergy (peanuts, milk, eggs), or some details about members that are picky eaters. The teacher should also assign a dollar amount for a weekly food budget for each family so that several socioeconomic levels will be represented.\\n\\nProcedure: 1. Students will form cooperative groups of three or four students. 2. Each group will be assigned a family that they will be shopping for and given a food budget for the family. 3. The groups will plan a weeks worth of meals for the family and use the grocery store ads to shop for the week. Menus should include breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for seven full days and meet the needs of the individual family members. They should also meet the daily nutritional requirements as identified on the Food Pyramid. 4. The groups will cut and paste the food items on the poster board. They will also write the number of each item they purchased and the cost. The completed poster should include a description of the family, the allowed budget, and the total amount spent. 5. Groups will present their completed poster to the class.\\n\\nEvaluation: 1. Completion of poster and group presentation.\\n\\n43\\n\\n2. All menus are balanced according to the Food Pyramid.\\n\\nrefer to ESL standards document\\n\\n“Shortenin’ Bread” Song Activity\\n\\nIn this song, a doctor tells the mother of three sick children that she needs to give them shortenin’ bread.

It was developed by the U.S.\\n\\nDepartment of Agriculture in 1992, and revised in 2005. The 2005 edition is flexible enough to adapt\\n\\nto a wide range of calorie levels, food preferences, and cuisines to meet the needs of different people.\\n\\nAn interactive version, MyPyramid, is available on the website www.mypyramid.gov. It estimates how\\n\\nmany calories a person needs based on age, gender, and physical activity.\\n\\nBASIC MESSAGES\\n\\nGet the most nutrition out of the day’s calories.\\n\\nMake smart choices from every food group.\\n\\nMix up your choices within each food group.\\n\\nFind your balance between food and physical activity.\\n\\nFOOD GROUPS AT DIFFERENT CALORIE LEVELS\\n\\nMost older adults need to consume about 1600 to 2400 calories per day, unless they have a high level\\n\\nof physical activity. Within each calorie level, the Pyramid gives advice for how many foods to consume\\n\\nwithin each food group. The next few pages list tips on what counts as a Pyramid serving in each food\\n\\ngroup. The source of this information is the USDA Pyramid (available at the website address of\\n\\nwww.mypyramid.gov).\\n\\nNote: Pyramid servings may not always be equal to servings of food listed for crediting purposes.

Do not read the comments to participants. This convention will be followed throughout the notes in this slide show.)\\n\\n(Give give each participant a copy of this presentation, obtained by printing the PDF version of these slides from the Training 2 folder on this CD-ROM.)\\n\\nThis session focuses on the five food groups and the best choices in each group. It also introduces the Nutrition Facts food label in more depth.\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe Five Food Groups\\n\\nGrains • Vegetables • Fruits • Meat, fish, and beans • Milk\\n\\n(Go over the five basic food groups with participants: grains; vegetables; fruits; meat, fish, and beans [meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts, and meat alternatives]; and milk.)\\n\\nThere are five basic food groups: grains; vegetables; fruit; meat, fish, and beans (meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts, and meat alternatives); and milk (which includes yogurt and cheese).\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe Balanced Plate for Health\\n\\n(Distribute the Balanced Plate for Health handout from the Additional Resources folder on this CD-ROM.)\\n\\nEach food group provides certain nutritional benefits, so foods from each group should be consumed each day.\\n\\nThe key to a balanced diet is to recognize that grains (especially whole grains), vegetables and fruits are needed in greater proportion than foods from the meat, fish & beans and milk groups. This principle is illustrated by the Balanced Plate for Health diagram that is used in several Eat Well & Keep Moving lessons.\\n\\nA healthy and balanced diet also contains a variety of foods from within each food group, since each food offers different macronutrients (the energy providing nutrients, namely carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).\\n\\nEating a variety of foods also keeps our meals interesting and full of flavor.\\n\\nNote that the Balanced Plate for Health does not contain sweets, foods that are high in saturated or trans fats, or foods that are low in nutrients. These are \"sometimes\" foods, not everyday foods. “Sometimes” foods should be eaten in moderation, and they are depicted on a small side plate.\\n\\nOkay – let’s move on to discussing each of the food groups in a little more detail.\\n\\n3\\n\\nGrains: Make at Least Half of Your Grains Whole Grains\\n\\nGrains contain carbohydrate, fiber, and\\n\\nsome vitamins and minerals.\\n\\nWhole grains are the healthiest choices. • Choose foods that list a whole grain as the first ingredient and that are rich in fiber. • Examples of whole-grain foods include\\n\\nwhole wheat bread, oatmeal, whole-grain crackers and breakfast cereals, whole wheat pasta, barley, brown rice, and plain popcorn.\\n\\n(Distribute the Food Group Examples handout from the Additional Resources folder on this CD-ROM. Distribute food labels from lesson 10 for Sweet Potatoes [page 156 in the book], Plums [page 156 in the book], Chicken [page 157 in the book], and Skim Milk [page 157 in the book]. Distribute any other food labels you have collected. Review the following information with participants:)\\n\\nBasic nutrients from the grains category are carbohydrate, fiber, and some vitamins and minerals.\\n\\nIn the grains group, the healthiest choices are whole grains, the less processed the better. Whole grains contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals; the refining process strips away many of these beneficial nutrients. Even though refined grains (such as white bread, white rice, and white pasta) are fortified with vitamins and minerals, fortification does not replace all of the lost nutrients.\\n\\nChoose foods that list a whole grain as the first ingredient. Examples of whole grains include whole wheat bread, oatmeal, whole-grain crackers and breakfast cereals, whole wheat pasta, and other whole grains such as barley, brown rice, and plain popcorn.\\n\\nLook at the % Daily Value (% DV) for fiber on the Nutrition Facts label. The % Daily Value tells you whether a food is low or high in a nutrient. Whole- grain foods have a higher % DV for fiber.\\n\\n4\\n\\nGo for 5 Fruits and Veggies— More Is Better!\\n\\nFruits and vegetables provide vitamins,\\n\\nminerals, and carbohydrate.\\n\\nEat 5 or more servings of fruits and\\n\\nvegetables every day.\\n\\nMore is better! Choose fruits and vegetables\\n\\nin a rainbow of colors.\\n\\nVegetables and fruits provide vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrate. In general they promote overall good health. Eat 5 or more servings of vegetables and fruits every day; eating more is better.\\n\\n5\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nGood source of vitamins A and C, folate,\\n\\niron, and magnesium\\n\\nLow in saturated and trans fat, high in fiber • Choose a rainbow of colors, especially dark\\n\\ngreen and deep orange\\n\\nOne serving = 1/2 cup cooked vegetables, 1 cup of leafy salad greens, small glass of 100% vegetable juice\\n\\nVegetables (e.g., broccoli, spinach, and carrots) provide vitamins A and C and folate as well as iron and magnesium. They are low in saturated and trans fat and high in fiber.\\n\\nChoose vegetables in a rainbow of colors, especially dark green (e.g., broccoli, spinach, romaine lettuce, bok choy, kale) and orange (e.g., carrots, sweet potatoes, winter squash).\\n\\n(Review the Sweet Potatoes Nutrition Facts label from page 156 in lesson 10 of the book, and discuss serving sizes and nutrients.)\\n\\nOne serving of vegetables is 1/2 cup of cooked or raw vegetables, 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, or a small glass of 100% vegetable juice.\\n\\n6\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nGood source of vitamins A and C and\\n\\npotassium\\n\\nLow in saturated and trans fat and high in\\n\\nfiber\\n\\nWhole and sliced fruits have more fiber than\\n\\njuice and are better choices\\n\\nOne serving = 1/2 cup chopped, cooked, or canned fruit; 1 medium apple, banana, or orange; a small glass of 100% juice\\n\\nFruits (e.g., oranges, cantaloupe, and strawberries) supply vitamins A and C as well as potassium. They are also low in saturated and trans fat and high in fiber.\\n\\nChoose whole fruits or sliced fruits rather than fruit juices, since they contain the most fiber; if eating canned fruit, choose fruit canned in juice (rather than fruit canned in syrup).\\n\\n(Review the Plums Nutrition Facts label from page 156 in lesson 10 of the book, and discuss differences in serving sizes and nutrients.)\\n\\nOne serving of fruit is 1 medium apple, banana, or orange; 1/2 cup chopped, cooked, or canned fruit; or a small glass of 100% fruit juice.\\n\\nMake sure to limit your consumption of 100% fruit juice to no more than 8 ounces per day; juice has vitamins and minerals, but it is naturally high in fruit sugar (fructose) and it lacks the fiber found in whole fruit.\\n\\n7\\n\\nMeat, Fish, and Beans\\n\\nContain protein, B vitamins, and minerals • Choose dry beans and peas, fish, poultry,\\n\\nnuts, and high-protein vegetarian alternatives more often than meat. • When eating meat, choose lean cuts. • Removing skin from poultry reduces\\n\\nsaturated fat.\\n\\nFoods in the meat, fish, and beans group supply protein, B vitamins, iron, and zinc. They are primarily responsible for building and repairing muscles and tissues, digesting nutrients, and improving immunity and blood quality.\\n\\nChoose dry beans and peas, fish, poultry, nuts, and high-protein vegetarian alternatives more often than meat; when eating meat, choose lean cuts; remove the skin from poultry to reduce saturated fat.\\n\\n(Review the Chicken Nutrition Facts label from page 157 in lesson 10 of the book, and discuss nutrients.)\\n\\n8\\n\\nMilk\\n\\nGood source of calcium; also contains\\n\\nprotein, riboflavin, and vitamins A and D • Promotes strong bones and healthy teeth • Choose plain low-fat (1%) or nonfat milk,\\n\\nyogurt, and other dairy foods.\\n\\nCalcium-fortified soy milk and rice milk are alternatives for people who do not drink milk.\\n\\nDairy products are the best sources of calcium. They supply protein, riboflavin, and vitamins A and D (if fortified). This group helps promote strong bones and healthy teeth.\\n\\nChoose plain low-fat (1%) or nonfat milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods. People who cannot drink milk can choose lactose-free milk or calcium- fortified plain soy milk or rice milk.\\n\\n(Review the Skim Milk Nutrition Facts label from page 157 in lesson 10 of the book, and discuss differences in nutrients.)\\n\\n9\\n\\nCombination and Processed Foods\\n\\nCombination foods contain foods from\\n\\nmore than one food group.\\n\\nProcessed foods are prepared and\\n\\npackaged by manufacturers.\\n\\nCombination foods contain foods from more than one food group (e.g., a brown rice and bean burrito with low-fat cheese: the tortilla and brown rice are in the grains group; the beans are in the meat, fish, and beans group; and the low-fat cheese is in the milk group).\\n\\nProcessed foods are those prepared and packaged by manufacturers. Salt and other sodium-containing ingredients are often used in food processing.\\n\\n10\\n\\nA Balanced Diet\\n\\nNo single food supplies all needed nutrients. • Choose foods from all the groups each day. • Follow these guidelines to make the best choices:\\n\\n– Eat 5 or more fruits and vegetables each day. – Choose whole-grain foods and limit foods and beverages with\\n\\nadded sugar.\\n\\n– Choose healthy fat, limit saturated fat, and avoid trans fat.\\n\\nNo single food can supply all the nutrients needed to maintain good health. Similarly, not all foods in the same group contain the same nutrients. Oranges, for instance, do not contain much vitamin A, but cantaloupe is a good source of this vitamin.\\n\\nChoosing foods from all the food groups each day and choosing a variety of foods within each food group will help you meet your nutritional requirements. It will also make your diet more interesting.\\n\\nTo make the best choices within each food group, remember the Balanced Plate for Health and these guidelines from the Principles of Healthy Living:\\n\\nEat 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day (especially eat dark- green and orange vegetables).\\n\\nChoose whole-grain foods and limit foods and beverages with added sugar.\\n\\nChoose healthy fat, limit saturated fat, and avoid trans fat.\\n\\n11\\n\\nEnergy Requirements\\n\\nAdults\\n\\n– Women need 1,800 to 2,000 calories per day. – Men need 2,200 to 2,400 calories per day. – Adults need more if they are very active.\\n\\nChildren\\n\\n– Girls aged 9 to 13 need 1,600 calories per day. – Boys aged 9 to 13 need 1,800 calories per day. – Children may need 400 calories more each day if\\n\\nthey are moderately active.\\n\\n– Very active boys and girls may need even more.\\n\\nWhen planning a balanced diet, we must also keep in mind the energy requirements for adults and children.\\n\\nMost women need 1,800 to 2,000 calories per day, and most men need 2,200 to 2,400 calories per day; people need more if they are very active.\\n\\nGirls aged 9 to 13 need about 1,600 calories per day, while boys aged 9 to 13 need 1,800 calories per day; girls and boys who are moderately physically active may need up to 2,000 calories per day (girls) and 2,200 calories per day (boys), and very active girls and boys (those who do the equivalent of walking more than 3 miles, or 5 kilometers, per day in addition to participating in regular daily activities) may need to consume even more.\\n\\n12\\n\\nReading Food Labels\\n\\nThe Nutrition Facts food label is printed on nearly all packaged foods. Reading these labels is an effective way to compare the saturated fat, trans fat, fiber, and other nutrient contents of various foods.\\n\\nThe food label uses a daily diet of 2,000 calories as a reference point for the number of calories a person needs each day. But you may require more or less than 2,000 calories, depending on your age, gender, level of physical activity, and intention to maintain, lose, or gain weight.\\n\\nTo calculate the energy needs for an adult, visit www.bcm.edu/cnrc/caloriesneed.htm.\\n\\n13\\n\\nUnderstanding % Daily Value\\n\\nThe % Daily Value (% DV) tells you whether\\n\\na food is low or high in a nutrient.\\n\\nConsider saturated fat:\\n\\n– Food with % DV ≤ 5 is low in saturated fat. – Food with % DV ≥ 20 is high in saturated fat. • Follow the daily goal for saturated fat:\\n\\n– Choose foods that together have <100% of the DV\\n\\nfor saturated fat.\\n\\n– It is easier to eat a healthy diet by choosing foods\\n\\nthat have ≤ 5% of the DV for saturated fat.\\n\\nThe % Daily Value (% DV) that appears on food labels lets you find out whether a food is high or low in a nutrient.\\n\\nRegarding saturated fat, if the % DV is 5 or less for an individual food, then the food is considered low in saturated fat. The more foods chosen that have a % DV of 5 or less for saturated fat, the easier it is to eat a healthier diet.\\n\\nThe overall daily goal is to select foods that together have less than 100% of the DV for saturated fat.\\n\\nThe same rule applies to the % DV for sodium.\\n\\n14\\n\\n% Daily Value for Other Nutrients\\n\\n% DV for vitamins, iron, calcium\\n\\n– Food with % DV ≤ 5 is low in a nutrient. – Food with % DV ≥ 20 is high in a nutrient. • Daily goal for vitamins, iron, calcium\\n\\n– Choose foods that together reach 100% of the DV\\n\\nfor these beneficial nutrients.\\n\\n– It is easier to reach 100% DV by choosing foods that\\n\\nare high in these nutrients.\\n\\nThe % DV also indicates whether a food is high or low in other nutrients like vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron.\\n\\nIf the % DV for any of these nutrients is 5 or less, the food is considered low in that nutrient.\\n\\nThe overall daily goal is to select foods that together reach 100% of the DV for these nutrients.\\n\\n15\\n\\nTrans Fat on the Food Label\\n\\nNo % DV is listed for trans fat, because it is\\n\\nunclear if there is any safe level.\\n\\nIt is best to avoid trans fat.\\n\\n– Look for “0 grams trans fat” on food label.\\n\\nAnd\\n\\n– Check ingredients list for partially hydrogenated oil. – Switch to products that do not contain trans fat or\\n\\npartially hydrogenated oil.\\n\\nThere is no % DV for trans fat, because it is unclear if there is any safe level of intake; the consumption of trans fat is strongly associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease, sudden death, and possibly diabetes.\\n\\nThus it is best to avoid trans fat from partially hydrogenated oils.\\n\\nFood labels list the number of grams of trans fat per serving. Products made with partially hydrogenated oils can still claim “0 grams trans fat” if they contain less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving. These small amounts of trans fat can add up over the course of the day. So watch out for the words partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients list.\\n\\nSwitch to an alternative product that does not contain partially hydrogenated oil, especially if it is a product you consume regularly.\\n\\n16\\n\\nCalculating % Daily Value for Saturated Fat\\n\\nDivide the number of grams of saturated fat\\n\\nper serving by 22 and multiply by 100.\\n\\nHere is an example:\\n\\n– 1 cup of whole milk has 5 grams of saturated fat. – (5 ÷ 22) x 100 = 23% DV for saturated fat.\\n\\nHow is % DV for saturated fat calculated?\\n\\nAlthough all food labels provide the % DV for nutrients, it is good to know how these values are calculated. The following instructions describe how the % DV for saturated fat is calculated:\\n\\nFor a particular food, divide the number of grams of saturated fat per serving by 22 and multiply by 100. (The number 22 is used because health experts recommend that a person eating a 2,000-calorie daily diet consume no more than 22 grams of saturated fat each day.)\\n\\nFor example, 1 cup of whole milk has 5 grams of saturated fat, and so (5 ÷ 22) x 100 = 23%.\\n\\nNotice that 5 grams does not sound like much, but for a person who requires 2,000 calories per day, just 1 cup of whole milk contains 23% of the DV for saturated fat.\\n\\n17\\n\\nAdding Up the Saturated Fat\\n\\nSnack foods Skim milk\\n\\nFruit salad\\n\\nMacaroni and cheese (2 servings)\\n\\nChocolate-frosted doughnut (1) Small fast-food cheeseburger\\n\\nOrange juice\\n\\nSpinach\\n\\nPeanut and cashew mix (1/4 cup)\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n% DV saturated fat 0%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n36%\\n\\n27% 28%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n9%\\n\\n100%\\n\\nWe are going to do an exercise focusing on the % DV for saturated fat.\\n\\n(Pass out photocopied food labels or the Percent Daily Values of Saturated Fat and Grams of Trans Fat for Fast Food chart from pages 86-88 in lesson 5 of the book.)\\n\\nLocate the calories per serving, the amount of saturated fat grams per serving, and the % DV for saturated fat as listed on the food label. Let’s determine which foods when combined add up to 100% of the recommended daily maximum of saturated fat. This is done by adding the % DVs for saturated fat of the foods until the combined % DVs equal 100%. It may take only 2 to 4 foods, depending on their saturated fat content.\\n\\n(Take suggestions from the participants or allow participants to work together in groups.)\\n\\n(The example on the slide shows that you can get a day’s worth of saturated fat from 2 servings of macaroni and cheese, one chocolate-frosted doughnut, one small fast-food cheeseburger, and 1/4 cup of peanut and cashew mix.)\\n\\nYou can use this approach with each of the nutrients whose % DV appears on food labels. For vitamins and minerals, eat foods totaling to at least 100% of the DV. For saturated fat, eat less than 100% of the DV.\\n\\n18\\n\\nTour de Health Tour de Health\\n\\n(Distribute the Tour de Health Scorecard from page 423 in lesson 30 of the book, several small slips of paper, and markers to each group. Shuffle the deck of Tour de Health Game Cards from pages 427-435 in lesson 30 of the book, and place it facedown on the top of a table. To speed up the game, cards marked Bonus have been added to the deck. When one of these cards is drawn, a group receives 4 points if it answers the question on the card correctly.)\\n\\nWe will now play a healthy living game that is part of the Eat Well & Keep Moving classroom lessons. Let’s review the directions and play a round of the game: Each group gets a scorecard and a marker. I (the trainer) will draw one card at a time, in order from the top of the deck, and read the category of the question (e.g., Whole Grains, Keep Moving). I will then read the question to all of the groups. Questions are either multiple choice or true or false. Each group should decide on a response to the question, and write down the answer on a slip of paper. I will ask each group for its response. When a group answers correctly, it will receive 1, 2, 3, or 4 points, depending on the value of the question. Each group enters its points on its scorecard in the related category column. For example, if a group earns 2 points for answering a Keep Moving question, it enters 2 points in the Keep Moving column.\\n\\n(Winning the game) (Option one: Play can be timed for 15 or 20 minutes, and the group with the most points at the end wins.) (Option two: First group to get 20 total points wins.) (If you like you may offer incentives or prizes (pens, T-shirts, gift certificates, trinkets, or hats) to the winners.)\\n\\n19\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\n(After the conclusion of Tour de Health, ask participants if they have any final questions.)\\n\\nThe next Eat Well & Keep Moving session will discuss the safe workout.\\n\\n20', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Five_Food_Groups.pdf'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Plant-Based Diets: A Physician’s Guide\\n\\nJulieanna Hever, MS, RD, CPT\\n\\nE-pub: 07/06/2016\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nBecause of the ever-increasing body of evidence in support of the health advantages of plant-based nutrition, there is a need for guidance on implementing its practice. This article provides physicians and other health care practitioners an overview of the myriad benefits of a plant-based diet as well as details on how best to achieve a well-balanced, nutrient-dense meal plan. It also defines notable nutrient sources, describes how to get started, and offers suggestions on how health care practitioners can encourage their patients to achieve goals, adhere to the plan, and experience success.\\n\\nSUMMARY OF HEALTH BENEFITS\\n\\nPlant-based nutrition has exploded in popularity, and many advantages have been well documented over the past sev- eral decades.1 Not only is there a broad expansion of the research database sup- porting the myriad benefits of plant-based diets, but also health care practitioners are seeing awe-inspiring results with their patients across multiple unique subspecialties. Plant-based diets have been associated with lowering overall and ischemic heart disease mortality2; supporting sustainable weight manage- ment3; reducing medication needs4-6; low- ering the risk for most chronic diseases7,8; decreasing the incidence and severity of high-risk conditions, including obesity,9 hypertension,10 hyperlipidemia,11 and hy- perglycemia;11 and even possibly reversing advanced coronary artery disease12,13 and type 2 diabetes.6\\n\\nThe reason for these outcomes is two- fold. First, there are inherent benefits to eating a wide variety of health-promoting plants. Second, there is additional benefit from crowding out—and thereby avoid- ing—the injurious constituents found in animal products, including the following: • Saturated fats: Saturated fats are a group of fatty acids found primarily in animal products (but also in the plant kingdom—mostly in tropical oils, such as coconut and palm) that are well es- tablished in the literature as promoting cardiovascular disease (CVD).14,15 The American Heart Association lowered its\\n\\nrecommendations15 for a heart-healthy diet to include no more than 5% to 6% of total calories from saturated fat, which is just the amount found natu- rally in a vegan diet (one consisting of no animal products).\\n\\nDietary cholesterol: Human bodies produce enough cholesterol for ad- equate functioning. Although evidence suggests that dietary cholesterol may only be a minor player in elevated serum cholesterol levels, high intakes are linked to increased susceptibility to low-density lipoprotein oxidation, both of which are associated with the promotion of CVD.16-18 Dietary cholesterol is found almost exclusively in animal products. • Antibiotics: The vast majority (70% to 80%) of antibiotics used19,20 in the US are given to healthy livestock animals to avoid infections inherent in the types of environments in which they are kept. This is, therefore, the num- ber one contributor to the increasingly virulent antibiotic-resistant infections of the type that sickened 2 million and killed 23,000 Americans in 2013.20 • Insulin-like growth factor-1: Insulin- like growth factor-1 is a hormone naturally found in animals, includ- ing humans. This hormone promotes growth. When insulin-like growth factor-1 is consumed, not only is the added exogenous dose itself taken in, but because the amino acid profile typical of animal protein stimulates the body’s production of insulin-like\\n\\nPerm J 2016 Summer;20(3):15-082\\n\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7812/TPP/15-082\\n\\ngrowth factor-1, more is generated endogenously.21 Fostering growth as a full-grown adult can promote cancer proliferation.\\n\\nHeme iron: Although heme iron, found in animal products, is absorbed at a higher rate than nonheme iron, found in plant-based and fortified foods, absorption of nonheme iron can be increased by pairing plant-based pro- tein sources with foods high in vitamin C.22 Additionally, research suggests that excess iron is pro-oxidative23 and may increase colorectal cancer risk24 and promote atherosclerosis25 and reduced insulin sensitivity.26\\n\\nChemical contaminants formed from high temperature cooking of cooked animal products: When flesh is cooked, compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,27 heterocyclic amines,28 and advanced glycation end products29 are formed. These compounds are carcinogenic, pro-inflammatory, pro- oxidative, and contributive to chronic disease.\\n\\nCarnitine: Carnitine, found primar- ily in meat, may be converted in the body by the gut bacteria to produce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). High levels of trimethylamine n-oxide are associated with inflammation, ath- erosclerosis, heart attack, stroke, and death.30\\n\\nN-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc): This compound is found in meat and promotes chronic inflammation.31,32 On the other hand, there are infinite advantages to the vast array of nutrients found in plant foods. Phytochemicals and fibers are the two categories of nu- trients that are possibly the most health promoting and disease fighting. Plants are the only source of these nutrients; they are completely absent in animals. Plants contain thousands of phytochemicals,\\n\\nThe Permanente Journal/Perm J 2016 Summer;20(3):15-082\\n\\n93\\n\\nJulieanna Hever, MS, RD, CPT, is a Dietitian and Author in Los Angeles, CA.

Yet more than 90% of adults and children in the US do not get the minimum recommended dietary fiber.42\\n\\nThus, it can be advantageous for physi- cians to recommend and support plant- based eating to achieve optimal health outcomes and possibly minimize the need for procedures, medications, and other treatments. Aiming for lifestyle changes as primary prevention has been estimated to save upwards of 70% to 80% of health care costs because 75% of health care spending in the US goes to treat people with chronic conditions.43 Offering this option and guiding patients through the logistics and their concerns about plant- based eating is a viable first line of therapy in the clinical setting. This article will delineate how best to achieve a well-bal- anced, nutrient-dense meal plan, define notable nutrient sources, describe how to get started, and offer suggestions on how physicians can encourage and work with their patients who are interested to maintain adherence and enjoy success.\\n\\nNOTABLE NUTRIENTS\\n\\nAlthough nutrient deficiency is a primary concern for many people when considering plant-based eating, the Acad- emy of Nutrition and Dietetics states44 that “vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treat- ment of certain diseases.” The Academy’s position paper goes on to conclude that\\n\\nTable 1. Food group recommended servings per day Food group Vegetables, all types, including starchy Fruits, all types Whole grains (eg, quinoa, brown rice, oats)\\n\\nLegumes (beans, peas, lentils, soy foods) Leafy green vegetables (eg, kale, lettuce, broccoli) Nuts (eg, walnuts, almonds, pistachios) Seeds (eg, chia, hemp, and flax seeds) Fortified plant milks (eg, soy, almond, cashew) Fresh herbs and spices\\n\\nRecommended servings per day\\n\\nAd libitum, with a variety of colors represented 2-4 servings (1 serving = 1 medium piece or 1/2 cup) 6-11 servings (1 serving = 1/2 cup cooked or 1 slice whole grain bread) 2-3 servings (1 serving = 1/2 cup cooked) At least 2-3 servings (1 serving = 1 cup raw or 1/2 cup cooked) 1-2 ounces 1-3 tablespoons Optional, 2-3 cups Optional, ad libitum\\n\\n“well-planned vegetarian diets are appro- priate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lacta- tion, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.” Because any type of meal plan should be approached with careful thought, it is helpful to note that plant- based diets, including calorie-restricted, weight-loss diets, have been found to be more nutritionally sound than typical dietary patterns.45\\n\\nA well-balanced, plant-based diet is composed of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, herbs, spices, and a small amount of nuts and seeds. Half of the plate should consist of vegetables and fruits in accordance with the US Department of Agriculture, American Cancer Society, and American Heart Association, because they are filled with fiber, potassium, mag- nesium, iron, folate, and vitamins C and A—almost all of the nutrients that tend to run low in the American population, according to the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Com- mittee.46 Legumes are excellent sources of lysine (an amino acid that may fall short in a plant-based diet), fiber, calcium, iron, zinc, and selenium. It is ideal to consume one to one-and-a-half cups of legumes per day. Substantiating meals with whole grains aids with satiety, energy, and versa- tility in cuisine. Nuts are nutritional nug- gets, brimming with essential fats, protein, fiber, vitamin E, and plant sterols, and have been shown to promote cardiovascular health47 and protect against type 2 diabetes and obesity,48 macular degeneration,49 and cholelithiasis.50 One oz to 2 oz (or 30 g to 60 g) of nuts per day is recommended.\\n\\nSeeds, too, are special in that their es- sential fat ratios are well-balanced, and they contain multiple trace minerals and phytochemicals. One or 2 tablespoons per day will boost overall nutrition. Opting for whole food sources of fats, as opposed to extracted fats as found in oils, is optimal to decrease caloric density and increase nutrient and fiber consumption. Herbs and spices also contain phytochemicals and help make food delicious, varied, and exciting, and should be used according to preference. Food group recommended servings per day are shown in Table 1.\\n\\nPLANT-BASED MACRONUTRITION\\n\\nAll calories (kcals) come from some combination of carbohydrates (4 kcals/g), proteins (4 kcals/g), and fats (9 kcals/g). Alcohol also provides calories (7 kcals/g) but is not considered an essential nutri- ent. The ideal ratio of intake of these 3 macronutrients is highly controversial and debatable. There is plenty of evidence supporting health and weight management benefits of low-fat/high-carbohydrate di- ets, as seen in the traditional Okinawan diet51 and in Dean Ornish, MD’s12 and Caldwell Esselstyn, MD’s13 reversal of ad- vanced coronary artery disease and Neal Barnard, MD’s6 reduction of glycemia in type 2 diabetes using a plant-based diet with 10% of calories from fat. Similarly, the Mediterranean52 and many raw food53 diets consisting of upwards of 36% or more of calories from fat show consistently positive health advantages. Thus, it appears that it is likely the quality of the diet that is responsible for health outcomes rather than the ratio of macronutrients.\\n\\n94\\n\\nThe Permanente Journal/Perm J 2016 Summer;20(3):15-082\\n\\nPlant-Based Diets: A Physician’s Guide\\n\\nCarbohydrates\\n\\nThe Institute of Medicine’s adequate intake of carbohydrates54 is 130 g/d for everyone (except during pregnancy and lactation) beginning at age 1 year. Optimal sources of carbohydrates, such as whole- some vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes, are high in fiber and nutrients. Refined carbohydrates from sugars, flours, and other processed foods can lead to mal- nourishment and promote illness.\\n\\nProtein\\n\\nAdequate intake54 of protein is based on weight and is estimated at 1.5 g/kg/d for infants, 1.1 g/kg/d for 1 to 3 year olds, 0.95 g/kg/d for 4 to 13 year olds, 0.85 g/kg/d for 14 to 18 year olds, 0.8 g/kg/d for adults, and 1.1 g/kg/d for pregnant (using prepreg- nancy weight) and lactating women. Protein is readily available throughout the plant kingdom, but those foods that are particu- larly rich in protein include legumes, nuts and nut butters, seeds and seed butters, soy foods, and intact whole grains.\\n\\nFats\\n\\nFats—or fatty acids—are more com- plicated because there are several differ- ent chemical varieties based on level and type of saturation. Each category of fatty acid performs different functions and acts uniquely in the body.14\\n\\nThe essential fatty acids are polyun- saturated and include both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats are found in their shorter chain form as al- pha linolenic acid and are used as energy. They are also converted by the body to the longer-chain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and then docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Because this conversion pro- cess can be inefficient, some people may require a direct source of these longer- chain EPA and DHA in the form of a microalgae supplement. Alpha linolenic acid can be found in flaxseeds, hemp- seeds, chia seeds, leafy green vegetables (both terrestrial and marine), soybeans and soy products, walnuts, and wheat germ, as well as in their respective oils. A direct plant source of EPA and DHA is microalgae, through which fish acquire them. Plant sources may be superior be- cause they do not contain the contami- nants that fish contain, including heavy\\n\\nmetals, such as mercury, lead, and cad- mium, as well as industrial pollutants.55 Also, plant sources are more sustainable than fish sources.56\\n\\nMonounsaturated fats are not essential but have been found to impart either a neutral or slightly beneficial effect on serum cholesterol levels, depending on which nutrient they are replacing. When swapped for saturated fats, trans fats, or refined carbohydrates, monounsaturated fats may lower low-density lipoprotein and raise high-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol. These fatty acids are found in olives, avocados, macadamia nuts, hazel- nuts, pecans, peanuts, and their respec- tive oils, as well as in canola, sunflower, and safflower oils.\\n\\nSaturated fats, as mentioned above, are not essential in the diet and can promote CVD. They are found primar- ily in animal products but are available in some plant foods, mostly in tropical fats and oils, such as palm and coconut, and also in other high-fat foods, includ- ing avocados, olives, nuts, and seeds. If a vegan diet contains an average of 5% to 6% of kcals from saturated fat, which is what the American Heart Organization recommends for a heart-healthy diet, any added serving of animal products will significantly increase the total intake.\\n\\nTrans fatty acids are laboratory-made via hydrogenation and are found in pro- cessed, fried, and fast foods. Although they were originally developed to be a healthy alternative to butter and lard, trans fatty acids were found to signifi- cantly increase CVD risk. In November 2013, the US Food and Drug Admin- istration issued a notice that trans fatty acids were no longer considered safe57 and is now trying to eliminate artifi- cially produced trans fatty acids (there are small amounts found naturally in meat and dairy products) from the food supply. Be aware that a nutritional label can state a food product contains “0 g trans fats” even if it contains up to 0.5 g per serving. Thus, advise your patients to focus on the ingredient list on food products and to avoid anything with the words “partially hydrogenated.”\\n\\nDietary cholesterol is a sterol that is found primarily in animal products. Although cholesterol is required for the\\n\\nproduction of hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids, the liver produces enough cholesterol on its own. Excessive intake of dietary cholesterol is associated with increased risk of CVD.\\n\\nPhytosterols, which are similar to cho- lesterol, are plant-based sterols found in all plant foods (especially wheat germ, nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, and unrefined plant oils). Phytosterols reduce cholesterol absorption in the gut, thereby optimizing lipid profiles. Together with viscous fibers, soy proteins, and almonds, phytosterols have been found to be as ef- fective as statins in some studies in lower- ing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.5,58 It is crucial to note that all whole foods contain all three macronutrients. It is a pervasive misunderstanding to identify a food as a “carb,” “protein,” or “fat.” Instead, these are all nutrients within a complex of other myriad constituents that are beyond the oversimplification perpetuated by the media and trendy diet fads.\\n\\nIdeally, a healthful diet is loaded with wholesome carbohydrates, moderate in fat, and temperate in protein. The emphasis must be on the quality of the totality of foods coming from whole plant sources as opposed to calculations and perfect ratios.\\n\\nPLANT-BASED MICRONUTRITION\\n\\nAll nutrients, with the exception of vi- tamin B12 and possibly vitamin D, which is ideally sourced from the skin’s exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays, can be found in plants. They are also packaged together with thousands of powerful disease-fight- ing nutrients that work synergistically to support optimal health.59\\n\\nVitamin B12\\n\\nCobalamin, commonly referred to as vitamin B12, is the only nutrient not directly available from plants. This is because vitamin B12 is synthesized by mi- croorganisms, bacteria, fungi, and algae, but not by plants or animals. Animals consume these microorganisms along with their food, which is why this vitamin can be found in their meat, organs, and byproducts (eggs and dairy). Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to irreversible neuro- logic disorders, gastrointestinal problems,\\n\\nThe Permanente Journal/Perm J 2016 Summer;20(3):15-082\\n\\n95\\n\\nPlant-Based Diets: A Physician’s Guide\\n\\nand megaloblastic anemia. Among other populations, vegans who do not supple- ment with a reliable source of vitamin B12 or breastfeeding infants of vegan mothers who are not consuming a regular reli- able source of vitamin B12 are at risk for deficiency.\\n\\nThe body can store vitamin B12 for ap- proximately three to five years, but after that, with no repletion or with inability to absorb, deficiency symptoms may present; deficiency may also be asymptomatic. Be- cause of this lag time and because serum tests for B12 levels can be skewed by other variables, irreversible damage may occur before a deficiency is caught.\\n\\nIn a vegan diet, vitamin B12 can be found in fortified plant milks, cereals, or nutritional yeast. However, these are not dependable means of achieving B12 requirements. Although there are claims that fermented foods, spirulina, chlorella, certain mushrooms, and sea vegetables, among other foods, can provide B12, the vitamin is not usually biologically active. These inactive forms act as B12 analogues, attaching to B12 receptors, preventing absorption of the functional version, and thereby promoting deficiency. The most reliable method of avoiding deficiency for vegans or anyone else at risk is to take a B12 supplement.\\n\\nBecause the body can absorb only ap- proximately 1.5 µg to 2.0 µg at a time, it is ideal to supplement with a dose greater than the Recommended Dietary Allow- ance (RDA) to ensure adequate intake. Plant-based nutrition experts recommend a total weekly dose of 2000 µg to 2500 µg. This can be split into daily doses or into 2 to 3 doses of 1000 µg each per week to help enhance absorption. Because vitamin B12 is water soluble, toxicity is rare.\\n\\nVitamin D\\n\\nVitamin D, or calciferol, is also known as the “sunshine vitamin” because it is the only nutrient that is acquired from the sun. Although vitamin D is classified as and treated like a fat-soluble vitamin, it is actually a prohormone produced in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B sun radiation and then activated by the liver and kidneys.\\n\\nAlthough human bodies evolved to produce vitamin D via the sun, there\\n\\nappears to be a worldwide epidemic of deficiency. Vitamin D is not widely available from the food supply. Sources of preformed vitamin D include fish liver oil, oily fish, liver, and in smaller doses, meat and egg yolk—foods that also contain high concentrations of saturated fat, cholesterol, and other less-than-ideal components. Vitamin D from sunshine and animal sources is in the form of cholecalciferol, or vitamin D3. A second form called ergocalciferol, or vitamin D2, is found in plant sources, mostly in ultraviolet B-irradiated mushrooms. However, a plant-derived version of D3 made by lichen was recently discovered.60 Dietary supplements may contain either D2 or D3, both of which can be effective at optimizing blood levels.\\n\\nMore and more physicians are testing for serum levels of vitamin D using the 25-hydroxyvitamin D test. The Institute of Medicine concluded that adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are ≥ 50 nmol/L (≥ 20 ng/mL).61\\n\\nIf patients have suboptimal levels, em- phasizing food sources (especially fortified plant milks) as well as supplements may be helpful. Dosing may be tricky because of variable responses in individuals and differences in types of vitamin D formu- las. Of note, although both of the 2 forms of vitamin D—cholecalciferol (D3) and ergocalciferol (D2)—are effective at rais- ing serum D levels in small doses (4000 IU or less), cholecalciferol (D3) is supe- rior when using large boluses. Because the supplement industry is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, it is “buyer beware” in the supplement market. Thus, aim to find well-reputed companies. A few organizations, such as Consumer Lab, NSF International, and US Pharmacopeia, act as independent third parties and offer seals of approval after testing products for potency and contaminants. They do not, however, test for safety or efficacy.\\n\\nCalcium\\n\\nCalcium, a macromineral, is the most abundant mineral in the human body. A mere 1% of the body’s calcium circulates in the blood and tissues; 99% is stored in the bones and teeth. Calcium is a nutrient of concern for the general population with\\n\\nrespect to bone mineral optimization dur- ing the lifespan. However, because bone metabolism is multifactorial and complex, it is important to emphasize consumption of ample sources of calcium as well as vi- tamins K and B12, fluoride, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium; to maintain serum vitamin D levels; and to ensure con- sistent exercise. Throughout the lifespan, dietary recommendations for adequate intake of calcium fluctuate.62\\n\\nExcellent plant sources of calcium in- clude leafy green vegetables—especially bok choy, broccoli, napa cabbage, collard greens, dandelion greens, kale, turnip greens, and watercress—as well as forti- fied plant milks, calcium-set tofu, dried figs, sesame seeds and tahini, tempeh, al- monds and almond butter, oranges, sweet potatoes, and beans.\\n\\nNo matter how much calcium is con- sumed, the amount that is actually absorbed is more significant. Many variables affect calcium levels via absorption or excretion, including: • Overall consumption determines how much is absorbed. Only about 500 mg can be absorbed at a time, and absorption decreases as calcium intake increases • Age. Calcium absorption peaks in in- fants and children, as they are rapidly growing bone, and then progressively decreases with age\\n\\nPhytates, compounds found in whole grains, beans, seeds, nuts, and wheat bran, can bind with calcium as well as with other minerals and inhibit absorp- tion. Soaking, sprouting, leavening, and fermenting improve absorption\\n\\nOxalates are constituents found in some leafy green vegetables, such as spinach, Swiss chard, collard greens, parsley, leeks, and beet greens; berries; almonds; cashews; peanuts; soybeans; okra; qui- noa; cocoa; tea; and chocolate. They may also somewhat inhibit absorption of calcium and other minerals, but some may still be absorbed. Emphasizing vari- ety in the foods eaten on a regular basis encourages adequate absorption\\n\\nSerum vitamin D levels must be within optimum range in order for the body to absorb calcium.\\n\\nExcessive intake of sodium, protein, caffeine, and phosphorus (as from dark sodas) may enhance calcium excretion.62\\n\\n96\\n\\nThe Permanente Journal/Perm J 2016 Summer;20(3):15-082\\n\\nPlant-Based Diets: A Physician’s Guide\\n\\nIron\\n\\nIronically, iron is one of the most abundant metals on Earth and yet iron deficiency is one of the most common and widespread nutritional deficiencies. It is the most common deficiency in the world and is a public health problem in both industrialized and nonindustrialized countries.63 It is particularly prevalent in women of childbearing age, pregnant women, infants, children, teenage girls, and anyone experiencing bleeding, such as people with ulcers, inflamed intestines caused by malabsorptive disorders, or heavy menstruation. Iron-deficiency ane- mia is no more common in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians.\\n\\nBecause plant-sourced iron is nonheme iron, which is susceptible to compounds that inhibit and enhance its absorption, the recommendation for vegans and veg- etarians is to aim for slightly more iron than nonvegetarians. Fortunately, this is easy to do with the wide array of iron-rich food choices in the plant kingdom. Leafy greens and legumes are excellent sources of iron and a multitude of other nutrients, so it is advantageous to include these foods often. Other good choices include\\n\\nsoy products, dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, sesame seeds, tahini, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, raisins, prunes, and cashews.\\n\\nIron absorption may be diminished in the presence of phytates, tannic acids from tea, calcium in dairy, fiber, poly- phenols in coffee and cocoa, and certain spices (eg, turmeric, coriander, chilies, and tamarind). To minimize this, separate iron-rich foods from these nutrients as much as possible. An example is to drink coffee or tea separately from meals or to mix up meal combinations. One of the best tips for optimizing iron absorption is to eat iron-rich foods in combination with foods high in vitamin C and organic acids. This improves solubility, thereby facilitating absorption. Examples of such optimizing food combinations are a green smoothie with leafy greens (iron) and fruit (vitamin C) or salad greens (iron) with tomatoes (vitamin C).\\n\\nIodine\\n\\nDietary sources of the trace mineral iodine are unreliable and fluctuate geo- graphically because of varying soil quali- ties. It is crucial for vegans to be mindful\\n\\nTable 2.

Sources of iodine include iodized salt and sea vegetables. However, it is important to note that iodine is not found in sea salts, gourmet salts, or other salty foods. One half-teaspoon of iodized salt provides the daily recommended 150-µg dose. Also, iodine levels in sea vegetables fluctuate dramatically, with some (especially dulse and nori) contain- ing safe amounts and others (such as kelp) harboring toxic doses. Hijiki, also spelled hiziki, should be avoided owing to its ex- cessive arsenic levels. A preexisting iodine deficiency, a selenium deficiency, or high intake of goitrogens (antinutrients found in cruciferous vegetables, soy products, flaxseeds, millet, peanuts, peaches, pears, pine nuts, spinach, sweet potatoes, and strawberries) can interfere with iodine absorption. There is no need to avoid goitrogenic foods as long as iodine intake is sufficient. If a patient does not enjoy sea vegetables or is minimizing intake of salt, an iodine supplement may be warranted.\\n\\nSelenium\\n\\nSelenium is a potent antioxidant that protects against cellular damage and also plays a role in thyroid hormone regula- tion, reproduction, and dialpha nucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Brazil nuts are an especially rich source of selenium in the plant kingdom. Although selenium content varies depending on the source, an average ounce (approximately 6 to 8 nuts) can provide 777% of the RDA. When accessible, one Brazil nut a day is an ideal way of meeting selenium recom- mendations. Other plant sources include whole grains, legumes, vegetables, seeds, and other nuts.\\n\\nZinc\\n\\nZinc supports immune function and wound healing; synthesis of protein and DNA; and growth and development throughout pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Because of the presence of phytates, bioavailability of zinc from plants is lower than from animal prod- ucts. Zinc deficiency may be difficult to detect in blood tests but can show up clinically as delayed wound healing, growth retardation, hair loss, diminished immunity, suppressed appetite, taste\\n\\nThe Permanente Journal/Perm J 2016 Summer;20(3):15-082\\n\\n97\\n\\nPlant-Based Diets: A Physician’s Guide\\n\\nabnormalities, or skin or eye lesions. Consider advising patients to aim for 50% or greater than the RDA of zinc daily by including legumes, cashews and other nuts, seeds, soy products, and whole grains. Preparation methods such as soak- ing, sprouting, leavening, and fermenting will improve absorption. Table 2 provides a convenient chart highlighting excellent sources of notable nutrients.\\n\\nHELPING PATIENTS GET STARTED\\n\\nTo support patients to delve into this therapeutic nutrition plan to help them prevent or manage chronic disease and improve or maintain their state of health, it is crucial to provide optimis- tic, simple, and strategic guidance. See Sidebar: Six-Step Guide for Initiating and Maintaining a Nutrition Dialogue with Patients.\\n\\nGUIDE FOR INITIATING AND MAINTAINING A NUTRITION DIALOGUE WITH PATIENTS\\n\\n1. During the first part of an office visit when interviewing patients regarding well- ness behaviors (typically covering exercise and smoking), include questions about diet, such as the following: • Do you eat at least 7 to 9 servings of\\n\\nvegetables and fruits every day?64\\n\\nHow many times per week do you eat fried foods/red meat/processed meat/ refined sugars?\\n\\nHow often do you choose whole grains\\n\\nover refined grains?\\n\\nDo you eat at least a cup to a cup-and- a-half of legumes (beans, lentils, peas) per day?\\n\\nDo you include leafy green vegetables\\n\\nin your daily diet? 2. When discussing a patient’s treatment plan, include diet as a viable option with positive effects (eg, improved gastrointes- tinal function, decreased risk for chronic diseases, and better outcomes for existing conditions).\\n\\n3. Advocate simple suggestions to start off. Instead of overwhelming a patient with drastic renovations to their current way of eating, begin with a few changes that can be made within reason. Some examples include the following: • Incorporate leafy green vegetables with at least two meals or snacks each day (enjoy a salad, add broccoli to pasta, try a green smoothie for breakfast or a snack).\\n\\nStart reducing intake of red and pro- cessed meat to once per week or less. • Opt for whole grains over refined (eg, brown rice instead of white rice, whole grain pasta instead of white pasta, 100% whole grain or sprouted bread).\\n\\nSuggested Internet Nutrition Resources\\n\\nwww.nlm.nih.gov https://ndb.nal.usda.gov http://vegetariannutrition.net http://nutritionfacts.org www.pcrm.org www.brendadavisrd.com www.veganhealth.org http://plantbaseddietitian.com www.theveganrd.com www.vrg.org/nutrition/ https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/lifecycle- nutrition/vegetarian-nutrition\\n\\nwww.vegansociety.com\\n\\nLabel-Reading Protocol\\n\\nIgnore misleading marketing ter-\\n\\nminology on labels (eg, “excellent source of,” “free of,” “natural”) • Focus solely on ingredient list and\\n\\nignore rest of packaging\\n\\nStrive to purchase foods with:\\n\\nOnly recognizable ingredients - Few total ingredients listed - Absence of artificial colors/ flavorings/sweeteners, refined sugars, preservatives, stabilizers, thickeners, or any unrecognizable names\\n\\nSix-Step Guide for Initiating and Maintaining a Nutrition Dialogue with Patients\\n\\n1.

Enlist all health care practitioners on the patient’s team to be aware of diet modification goals. One way to simplify this is by charting progress and goals.\\n\\n5. Offer patients educational support (see Sidebar: Suggested Educational Support). Information in the form of pamphlets, onsite nutrition counsel- ing, in-house cooking classes, and articles on the Internet (see Sidebar: Suggested Internet Nutrition Resources) is ideal because there are multiple points of reference and communication for patients.\\n\\n6.

Demonstrations and interactive methods where- by participants are able to prepare food or at least taste samples and receive recipes to take home will inspire adherence.\\n\\nArticles on the Internet (see Sidebar: Internet Nutrition Resources) and other online resources (or even nutrition-specific Web sites) are opportunities to provide patients with ready-to-go information and perhaps a 24-hour interac- tive resource.\\n\\nTips for Patient Motivation\\n\\nInternet Nutrition Resources) is ideal because there are multiple points of ref- erence and communication for patients. It is also important to educate pa- tients on the importance of reading labels (see Sidebar: Label-Reading Protocol).\\n\\n6. Maintain a plan for follow-up and continued encouragement.

Pharmaceu- ticals are an important tool in a physician’s armamentarium, particularly in treating acute illness, but lifestyle changes, eg diet, can be an important and powerful tool in treating chronic illness. To facilitate lower health care costs and likely better health outcomes, let food be medicine and the route of the future. v\\n\\nDisclosure Statement\\n\\nThe author(s) have no conflicts of interest to\\n\\ndisclose.\\n\\nAcknowledgment\\n\\nFocus on optimism.

Every bite matters.\\n\\nEncourage the conversation with patients who are interested. The single person most people trust for advice and recommendations on health, diet, and well- ness is their physician. It is an honor and special occasion to be able to open up the dialogue from a place of caring and support and without judgment. Of- fer advice and an ear to help propel patients onto the path of long-term health.\\n\\nMake it fun. Recalculating diet is similar to learning a new language. Initially, a few new ingredients are discovered, which is like learning some new words. Then enjoyable recipes and meals become part of the repertoire, which is simi- lar to learning some phrases in the new language. Finally, the knowledge base expands so greatly that it becomes second nature to choose and prepare plant- based meals, akin to speaking the language fluently. Health care practitioners are ideally situated to easily guide patients toward fluency and success in this new language.\\n\\nHow to Cite this Article Hever J. Plant-based diets: A physician’s guide.

              " Document(page_content='BASIC NUTRITION 101\\n\\nTo begin with, an understanding of the basic fundamentals of food and nutrition is essential for anyone who wants to maintain a healthful lifestyle or to remedy some bad habits that have resulted in the necessity to make lifestyle changes for health and for a more rewarding life overall. As we age, the body naturally ages along with us and systems that once worked so well when we were younger may encounter difficulties sustaining their vital functions at or near previous levels. Many of these things that affect the efficiency of our bodily functions are caused by us and the 2 biggest culprits are nutrition and fitness. The following is a very surface explanation of some of the most basic concepts of nutrition.\\n\\nMarco nutrients:\\n\\nCarbohydrates: There are 2 types of carbohydrates and 3 if you include fiber;\\n\\nhowever, since fiber contributes no actual nutrients, it is included for personal understanding. Protein: Fats: Saturated/ unsaturated/ polyunsaturated\\n\\n-\\n\\nMicro nutrients:\\n\\nVitamins - Minerals -\\n\\nPhytonutrients(phytochemical)\\n\\nSome vocabulary that you should know includes:\\n\\nGlycemic index - BMI - Insulin resistance - Blood sugar ( glucose) - Bio-individuality - Metabolism - Calorie - Acid/alkaline (ph) balance - Pancreas - Carbohydrate - Protein - Fat\\n\\nTo begin with every person is a unique, one of a kind organism. Therefore, no 2 people will experience food or its’ benefits and hazards in the same exact way. Some people can drink milk all day long with no adverse effects, while others will experience severe reactions to the sugar in milk. Some children can eat peanut butter every day, while another child can die from an extreme allergic reaction. This is called bio-\\n\\nindividuality and each person must be aware of those foods that benefit them and those that can harm them.\\n\\nWhen it comes to food, it is probably the single most unifying experience of our lives. Food is present at every social and cultural gathering where people come together. From the birth of a child to the death of an individual, food is always center stage. So to not understand food and its’ effects can have an enormous impact on our lives, positively and negatively.\\n\\nAmount of energy yielded by foods:\\n\\nCarbohydrates: Whether they are simple or complex, nutrient dense or processed\\n\\nwith no nutrients, supply 4 calories per gram(weight of measurement). Protein: Supplies 4 calories per gram of protein just like carbs do Fats: Whether they are good fats or bad fats, supply 9 calories per gram of fat.\\n\\n- - Vitamin/Minerals/Phytonutrients/: provide no energy per weight, but are essential in\\n\\nhow the foods we eat are utilized.\\n\\nWater: no calories per weight - Alcohol: 7 calories per gram with zero nutrients\\n\\nThere are 2 types of carbohydrates that yield energy for us. Simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates. Without getting technical, it is the simple carbohydrates that provide energy and cause a multitude of health problems. The complex carbohydrates, while supplying the same amount of energy do not possess the same dangers as simple carbs. However, like anything else, excesses will over ride anything that is healthy when it comes to carbohydrates.\\n\\nSIMPLE CARBOHYDRATES: They are called simple because there really is not much to them. They are 1 or 2 sugars combined chemically that are instantly metabolized and very quickly enter the blood stream as glucose( blood sugar). Simple carbs begin their metabolic breakdown in the mouth and by the time they reach the small intestine they are completely broken down and instantly are injected into the blood stream. Although, glucose is essential to create cellular energy, the constant bombardment of glucose, unrestrictedly, causes the pancreas to secret insulin repeatedly over and over throughout the day. Since simple carbohydrates are an instant form of energy, they get absorbed instantly and used up just as quickly, making us hungry very shortly afterwards. Because we use the energy so quickly and get hungry so quickly afterwards, we enter into a vicious cycle of sugar highs and sugar lows that is repeated over and over. As a result of this sugar cycling, the pancreas is required to release more and more insulin every time to facilitate glucose’s entry into the cells for energy. Over time, the pancreas as you would expect gets over worked and over tired, resulting in a condition known as insulin resistance, which is a pre cursor for diabetes type 2. When this occurs, the mechanisms that allow glucose to enter into the cells, begins to mal function and the sugar is denied access to the cells and re-enters the blood stream. Only this time, the insulin takes the excess glucose which has nowhere to go and converts the excess sugar in fat cells, usually being deposited in the belly as “ belly fat”. Unless this cycle is stopped by changes in your diet, the sequence will be constantly repeated and fat has NO limitations as to how much it can grow and influence other cells to help it grow by sending it more and more fat. At this point,\\n\\nthe belly fat becomes an actual, living, breeding organism that wants to grow and multiply. It sends out messenger cells to convince other systems to send its excesses to it. Combined with that, the belly fat possesses the potential for serious illness such as diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, heart disease, etc. All that excess fat is pressing on vital organs that lie on the other side of all that fat and cause these vital system to become fatty and eventually fail, resulting in chronic illness and eventual death.\\n\\nBecause the body constantly seeks to be in balance between acidity and alkaline, and because the diet of processed carbohydrates is overwhelmingly acidity in nature, the pH balance is out of balance and causes a condition known as “ leaky gut syndrome”. This becomes highly toxic because microscopic bacteria that should be dealt with in the metabolic process, enters the blood stream through tiny pockets created in the intestine from the excess acids.\\n\\nCOMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES: The reason they are called complex is because there is much more to them. These are long chains of sugars that also eventually end up in the blood as blood sugar; however, since the chains are much longer, the breakdown also takes much longer. The result being more of a time- released injection of sugar with an identical time-released, manageable release of insulin from the pancreas. Many complex carbohydrates also contain fiber. Fiber is essential to keeping out entire GI tract healthy and it also makes the stomach feel fuller and causes the breakdown of carbs into glucose to take much longer. The result is you do not get as hungry as quickly and when you do eat the release of sugar and insulin does not result in glucose- insulin rushes.\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF SIMPLE CARBOHYDRATES:\\n\\nPizza\\n\\nAll processed foods - - White bread - White flour - Candy - - - Breakfast cereals almost exclusively -\\n\\nSoda Fruit juices\\n\\nSports drinks\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES:\\n\\nAll green leafy vegetables - Whole grains - Organic non processed cereals - - Whole wheat bread ( not wheat bread- all bread comes from wheat) - Vegetables\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nPROTEIN: Protein provides the same number of calories per gram, 4, as do carbohydrates. Protein is made up of amino acids which are the by- product of protein metabolism. The function of the amino acids is to build and maintain body tissue through their interaction with hormones and enzymes. One of the problems with protein is that it often is piggy-backed with fat. So when looking to include protein in the diet it is always preferable to select protein that is lean and organic, and has as little fat as possible. The fat that accompanies protein is also generally saturated fat and should be limited to small amounts each day. Protein can be used in a pinch to supply energy to cells, but it is not its’ primary function. Protein is also essential to the human immune system, coupling with vitamins and minerals and enzymes and hormones to protect the body from outside invasions of harmful bacteria and viruses’.\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF PROTEINS:\\n\\n\\n\\nLean protein: Fish/ poultry/ meats/ low fat yogurt/ low fat cheeses/beans/legumes.\\n\\nOf all the available proteins, wild fatty fishes like salmon and mackerel are excellent sources of protein and the essential omega-3 fatty acids. Beans and legumes offer excellent sources of protein while being very low in fat.\\n\\nFATTY ACIDS: Fats come in many sizes and provide the body with high density energy. Since each gram of fat contains 9 calories per gram, it offers twice the energy potential as carbohydrates. It is important to understand that all fats are not equal. The 3 types of fat are:\\n\\n\\n\\nSaturated fat: most commonly associated with hypertension and coronary heart disease.\\n\\nUnsaturated fat -\\n\\nPolyunsaturated fats.\\n\\nFat serves as protection to the skeletal system and potentially provides a lot of energy. It is also essential for the absorption of the fat soluble vitamins, A,D,E and K. Without fat to transport these essential vitamins, they would go through the digestive system and perform no function what so ever. When selecting food for your sustainable diet, always look to avoid saturated fat as much as possible.\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF FAT: Vegetable oils/ cheeses/ milk/ dairy/meats/all processed foods/ all fast foods.\\n\\nMICRONUTRIENTS: Vitamins/ minerals/ phytochemicals: are all essential to keep body systems balanced and in strong working order. Provide the body with what it needs and the body is engineered and genetically programmed to use these nutrients in a balanced diet without any help from us. The lungs never forget to breath, the heart never forgets to beat; the blood never doesn’t go to the right places.\\n\\nGLYCEMIC INDEX: This is an important concept to understand because it directly affects the blood sugar- insulin balance. Glucose has a glycemic load of 100. That is the highest number, since glucose is blood sugar. Diets should strive to include as many low glycemic loaded foods as possible, and avoid foods with a high glycemic load. The biggest problem food in this regard is processed wheat, including GMO wheat. The glycemic load of white bread, white flour and many processed foods exceeds 70 and higher, while fruits and vegetables come in at levels in the 20’s, 30’s and 40’s. The higher the glycemic load, the more sugar in the blood which causes more insulin to be secreted and once again that dangerous sugar high-insulin high (hyperglycemia) followed by sugar lows(hypoglycemia) and insulin lows cycle gets stimulated and only bad things happen when that repeats itself over and over again over time.\\n\\nIt would not be an easy task to find out the glycemic index of foods or if a food is a GMO, but if you tailor your diet around fresh, organic green leafy vegetables and other vegetables, whole grain wheat products, fresh, organic fruits, and lean sources of protein, it will work itself out correctly in your favor.\\n\\nIn selecting your fruits and vegetables, it is probably a good thing for you to avoid GMO’s. There is an awful lot of passion about this issue both for and against, so to avoid a political argument advocating or condemning them is a discussion that is not relevant, other than to say, it is my personal preference to avoid GMO products. The food stores and food manufacturers’ will not make this discovery easy for you, because they do have agendas, which transcend whether a product of GMO origins is healthful or unhealthful. Remember this is a multi-billion dollar industry. However if you use the following guide you can be sure of what you are buying.\\n\\nAll fruits and vegetables contain a PLU, which stands for price look-up code. It can be found on the fruit itself and on the vegetables, you will find it on the tie around the vegetables and the tag on fruits. The following is how fruits and vegetables are coded for food sellers:\\n\\nConventional produce: A 4 digit number beginning with either a 3 or a 4. - Organic produce: A 5 digit number beginning with a 9 - GMO produce: a 5 digit number beginning with an 8\\n\\nCALORIES: Calories are so minute in their energy output that when someone refers to calories, it is actually a K-calorie, or 1000 tiny energy units comprising the energy output of a calorie. Scientifically, a calorie is a unit of measure of the energy in that food. If a food has 20 calories, that represents a number that enables the consumer to understand if a product is high or low in energy yield. Obviously, the higher the caloric number, the more potential energy it provides. The important thing to understand about calories is whether that food product, yielding that amount of energy, is nutrient dense or nutrient empty, or “empty calories” When a food is nutrient dense, it means that the food yielding that energy, provides a lot of energy with a low caloric intake. For example, a box of raisins contains approximately 250 calories, and you know how quickly you can down that box and even look for another box or additional food. The box of raisins is nutrient empty when compared to 4 cups of grapes which yields about 287 calories. Low calories combined with a higher energy volume equals nutrient dense. You would be hard pressed to sit and eat 4 cups of grapes in one sitting. Vegetables are extremely nutrient dense, as is fruit and most non-processed foods, which fall under the category. Processed foods\\n\\nfor want of a better name are generally “junk food”, high volume, high calories and very little if any nutrient yield.\\n\\nBASAL METABOLISM: This represents the amount of energy(calories), needed to simply sustain life. If you were to lie in bed all day long you would burn energy to:\\n\\nBreath - Heart pumping blood - Nervous system sending out millions of messages - Cellular metabolism - - Any incidental body movement - Waste removal system working on food previously eaten - Maintaining body temperature - Maintaining pH levels\\n\\nThinking\\n\\nThe body does all these things for us without any prompting from us. Our heart never misses a beat, our lungs do not forget to breathe, and blood travels millions of miles transporting energy and messages to every single cell in the body. This accumulation of energy needs is what makes up our basal metabolism. To asses our personal energy requirements you have to factor in your body weight, daily activities of life (functional exercise) and exercise.\\n\\nBMI: Body Mass Index, is a number used to determine if you are clinically at the correct weight range, over-weight, or obese. To calculate that number for you personally, the following formula needs to be used:\\n\\nBody weight in kilograms( body weight divided by 2.2), divided by the square of a persons’ height in meters( 1 meter=39.3 inches).\\n\\nUnderweight= BMI of less than 19 - Normal weight= BMI of 19-25 - Overweight= BMI of 26-30 - Mild obesity= BMI of 31-35 - Moderate obesity= BMI of 36-40 - Morbid obesity= BMI of 41-50 - Severe obesity= BMI of 50 plus\\n\\nIn conclusion, a diet can mean many things to many people, however, all diets must be able to be sustainable, or it will fail. It is a shift in attitude to recognize that eating is a life-style activity and that you control whatever it is you eat. If a diet asks you to be a vegan or a South Beach or an Atkins, it really doesn’t matter as long as the diet provides nutrient dense foods, that are low in sugar and low in all processed foods, and, this is the key, foods that you enjoy and that satisfy your likes. Any diet that asks\\n\\nyou to deprive yourself and stresses foods you dislike will fail and probably result in you going off the diet and gaining more weight than you started with. On the other hand, a sensible, life-long system of eating that supplies low calories and high density nutrients, lean protein and unsaturated fats, combined with occasional treats (ice cream, cake, etc.), will satisfy all your health needs and be delicious.\\n\\nFood is pleasurable and bad food, “comfort foods”:, are even more pleasurable, so you must be able to balance your diet of eating healthy and treating yourself OCCASIONALLY.

All right reserved United States of America\\n\\nPublished by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salt Lake City, Utah\\n\\nNutrition and Diet\\n\\nThe Word of Wisdom contains the Lord’s outline of the kinds of food that provide good nutrition.\\n\\nBalanced nutrition (1) includes drinking plenty of clean water and regularly eating foods from each of six food groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, milk products, meat and beans, and oils. These foods contain six kinds of nutrients: proteins (2), carbohydrates (3), fats (4), minerals (5), vitamins (6), and water (8). A person should regularly eat or drink enough of all of these nutrients to grow and remain healthy. For infant nutrition (8), mother’s milk itself provides an ideal balance of nutrients, with the gradual introduction of solid foods after four to six months of age.\\n\\nIf a variety from all food groups is eaten regularly, it is not usually necessary to take supplements (9). Even carefully chosen vegetarian (10) diets that include dairy products or eggs can be quite sufficient. But if little or no animal products are eaten, then grains must be eaten with legumes (beans, peas, peanuts, and lentils), nuts, and seeds to provide balanced protein.\\n\\nFood and drink must also be clean and free from disease-causing germs (bacteria, viruses, and parasites) to be healthy. Purified water (10) (potable water) is prepared by removing dirt from the water and treating the water to remove or kill germs. In some areas, the government purifies water that is delivered through secured plumbing; this water is safe to use directly from the faucet for food and drink. In most of the world, however, water should be purified before use. Foods (11) should be washed free of dirt and then peeled, cooked, boiled, or sanitized before eating.\\n\\nFood must be eaten in proper amounts (14, 15) to maintain good health. Eating disorders (12) are serious, negative eating behaviors that can be fatal if untreated. Generally, obesity (12) results from eating more while malnutrition (13) results from eating less food than needed for growth, maintenance, and daily activity. Daily energy needs (14, 18) can be estimated based on age, height, weight, and level of activity. The body mass index (14, 17) (BMI) can be a useful measure of the degree of under-nutrition or over-nutrition.\\n\\nMore details about each of the underlined topics can be found in this guide on the pages shown in parentheses. Additional information not provided by the Church can be obtained online by clicking on the underlined links throughout the PDF version of this document.\\n\\nBalanced Nutrition\\n\\nWhat foods should be eaten to provide a good balance of nutrients?\\n\\nNutrition is best balanced by eating the right\\n\\namounts of a large variety of foods.\\n\\nThis provides the protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and vitamins needed for a healthy body.\\n\\nThe right amounts of water and exercise are\\n\\nalso critical to good health.\\n\\nA balanced diet is often represented by different\\n\\nsymbols\\n\\nA wheel, plate, or circle symbol suggests a\\n\\nbalance of foods is desirable.\\n\\nThe rainbow symbol emphasizes variety. A pyramid symbol recommends the number\\n\\nof servings from various food groups decreases from a solid foundation at the bottom (or the base) to the top.\\n\\nDifferent cultures may use different symbols\\n\\nof healthy food intake based on foods available to them.\\n\\nAll symbols have in common a variety of food\\n\\nintake from different food groups.\\n\\nthe high sugar tends to replace other needed foods.\\n\\nDairy products provide complete proteins and\\n\\nmajor minerals, particularly calcium.\\n\\nThey are commonly supplemented with\\n\\nvitamin D and vitamin A. If dairy products are not consumed in the recommended amounts, special efforts should be made to eat other calcium-rich foods or take a calcium supplement. This is particularly important for women. Complete protein can be provided by meat,\\n\\nchicken, eggs, fish, and soybeans (e.g., tofu). Legumes (e.g., beans) can also provide\\n\\ncomplete protein if nuts/seeds or grains such as rice or corn are eaten at the same meal to provide limiting amino acids. Vegetable oils can provide a balance of\\n\\nessential fatty acids.\\n\\nUse them in food preparation (frying, salad\\n\\ndressings, spreads, etc.).\\n\\nCanola and soy oils are preferred. Mustard and hemp seed oils are similar but\\n\\nGrains provide mostly carbohydrates as\\n\\nless common.\\n\\nstarches.\\n\\nThey also provide some protein that needs to be combined with legumes (beans), nuts, seeds, dairy, or meat to be complete. Half of the grain category should be from\\n\\nwhole grains for fiber and vitamins.\\n\\nVegetables provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Certain vegetables such as potatoes also\\n\\nprovide carbohydrates and some vegetable protein, which needs to be eaten with another protein food to be complete.\\n\\nFruits provide different vitamins, minerals, and\\n\\nfiber.\\n\\nThey also provide sugars for quick energy. ½ to ¾ cup or 120 to 180 mL of fruit juice is the same as one serving of fruit. It is not wise to drink much more than this because\\n\\nOlive oil is high in healthy monounsaturated fat and has a good ratio (although relatively low amounts) of essential fatty acids. Peanut, corn, sesame, sunflower, and\\n\\nsafflower oils are relatively low in essential omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nHalf of servings in the oil category should be one of the vegetable oils providing essential fatty acids each day. Tropical oils (e.g., coconut and palm) are extremely low in essential fatty acids.\\n\\nDiscretionary calories should be limited to avoid\\n\\nexcessive weight gain.\\n\\nSatisfying appetite with sweets limits eating of vitamin-, mineral-, and protein-rich foods important to good health and function.\\n\\nLow fat dairy products and lean meat should be used or discretionary calories reduced.\\n\\n1\\n\\nA simple summary of food groups and good\\n\\nnutrition includes:\\n\\nGrains for carbohydrates and fiber. Brightly colored vegetables and fruits for\\n\\nvitamins, minerals, and fiber. Dairy for calcium and protein. Meats, legumes (beans), and nuts for\\n\\nproteins.\\n\\nFats (oils) scattered among the foods for\\n\\nessential fatty acids.\\n\\nIodized salt should be used in all food preparation, even if it costs more, to avoid goiters which occur in many parts of the world.\\n\\nSee Nutrition Calculations (14) to determine the appropriateness of your weight, your daily calorie (energy) needs, the number of servings of each food group required to meet those needs, and the sizes of those food servings.\\n\\nAdditional resources: U.S. Department of Agriculture; Food Pyramid U.S. Department of Agriculture; Dietary Guidelines American Heart Association; food portion control American Cancer Society; food portion control\\n\\nProteins - “The biological essence of life”\\n\\nWhat are proteins and where do they come from?\\n\\nWhy are proteins important?\\n\\nProteins are the “building blocks of life” and necessary for good health. Proteins are made of chains of up to 20 different amino acids. During digestion, proteins are broken down into amino acids for the body to use. Amino acids are generated by the body or obtained through food. There are eight “essential” amino acids that cannot be made by adult bodies and must be eaten. “Complete” proteins contain all the essential amino acids in adequate amounts. Foods with complete proteins include meats and animal products such as milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. Soybean proteins, as in tofu or “soy milk,” are also complete proteins. “Partially complete” proteins contain all the essential amino acids, but the amount of one or more of those essential amino acids is inadequate. Most proteins in a plant group are only “partially complete” but can be made “complete” if combined with another protein source: ― legumes (beans) + grains = “complete” protein (e.g., peanut butter sandwich) ― grains + dairy = “complete” protein (e.g.,\\n\\ncereal and milk)\\n\\n― grains + nuts or seeds = “complete” protein\\n\\n(e.g., granola)\\n\\nProvide needed components for gene and cell reproduction. Carry out the instructions of the genes in the cells. Form a major part of muscle, including the heart. Make up tendons and most connective tissues. Help make up collagen and cartilage, which determines the shape of the skeleton. Direct and control the chemical reactions of life as enzymes. Direct and balance body functions as hormones. Repair body damage by forming scar tissue. Defend against infection as antibodies.\\n\\nHow can babies receive an adequate amount of protein? Breast milk is an ideal source of protein for the first 12 to 24 months of life, because it:\\n\\nHas a perfect balance of amino acids. Does not cause allergy. Provides all needed nutrients for normal-term infants. ― Additional minerals, vitamins, and other\\n\\nnutrients are needed after the first 6 months.\\n\\n― Low-birth-weight infants may also need additional nutrients for rapid growth.\\n\\nAdditional resources: NIH Medline Encyclopedia, protein Harvard Hospital nutrition source, protein\\n\\n2\\n\\nCarbohydrates\\n\\nWhat are carbohydrates?\\n\\nMost carbohydrates (“hydrated carbon”) contain atoms from one water molecule (H2O) for each atom of carbon (C).\\n\\nA monosaccharide is the basic dietary\\n\\ncarbohydrate and has six carbons. Examples are glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose is the sugar in blood. Fructose is twice as sweet as glucose and found in fruits. Galactose is less sweet than glucose and present in milk.\\n\\nDisaccharides form when two monosaccharides\\n\\njoin together.\\n\\nglucose + glucose\\n\\nDIETARY DISACCHARIDES maltose\\n\\nfrom starch\\n\\nGlycogen lasts less than a day if not replenished from the diet and can be depleted within a few hours with intense activity.\\n\\nIf carbohydrates are not replenished regularly,\\n\\nthe body uses protein to make glucose for tissues which require it for energy.\\n\\nCan eating or drinking certain carbohydrates cause diabetes mellitus to appear early if one is at risk (e.g., has a family history of diabetes, obesity, or sedentary lifestyle)?\\n\\nHigh-glycemic-index foods increase risk. They include sugary beverages, cornflakes, many bakery items (bread, crackers, cookies, pastries, etc.), rice, and potatoes. ― They are easily digested and increase blood\\n\\nglucose + fructose\\n\\nsucrose\\n\\ntable sugar\\n\\nsugar quickly.\\n\\nglucose + galactose\\n\\nlactose\\n\\nmilk sugar\\n\\nStarches in vegetables and grains are long\\n\\nchains or polymers of glucose. Cornstarch is broken into short chains of glucose to make corn syrup; using special enzymes makes high- fructose corn syrup, a popular sweetener. \\uf0b7 Cellulose is also a long chain or polymer of glucose. It is one of several indigestible carbohydrates called fiber.\\n\\nLow-glycemic-index foods increase risk less.\\n\\nThey include pasta, high-fiber foods, legumes, oatmeal, milk, yogurt, nuts, peanut butter, and whole fruits. ― They are digested more slowly and influence\\n\\nblood sugar less.\\n\\nWhy are some people lactose intolerant?\\n\\nLactose cannot be used until it is broken down\\n\\ninto its two parts by the enzyme lactase.\\n\\nVirtually all infants have enough lactase to digest\\n\\nWhy are carbohydrates important?\\n\\nthe lactose in milk.\\n\\nProvide energy for brain, muscle, and other body\\n\\nfunctions.\\n\\nCombine with proteins or fats to form important\\n\\nparts of cartilage, connective tissue, the nervous system, and the immune system.\\n\\nContribute to stool softness and normal bowel\\n\\nfunction as fiber. Large amounts of some fibers in the bowel can ferment to produce gas (flatus).\\n\\nHow are carbohydrates digested and controlled?\\n\\nDisaccharides and starches are digested into\\n\\nmonosaccharides in the intestine.\\n\\nThe monosaccharides are absorbed and carried\\n\\nto the liver.\\n\\nThe liver uses the glucose or converts other\\n\\nmonosaccharides to glucose for circulation or storage (glycogen).\\n\\nCirculating glucose fuels nerves, brain, eyes, and\\n\\nother tissues without requiring insulin.\\n\\nWhen blood glucose is high, insulin moves it into\\n\\nmuscle and fat cells.\\n\\nWhen blood glucose lowers between meals, liver\\n\\nglycogen is broken down to maintain it.\\n\\nLactase levels diminish with age in most\\n\\npopulations causing lactose intolerance. ― Undigested lactose passes through the intestine and into the large bowel. ― Bacteria in the large bowel ferment the\\n\\nlactose into gas and acids.\\n\\n― Fermentation produces flatus (gas), cramps,\\n\\nand diarrhea.\\n\\n― Butter, cheese, yogurt, and even small\\n\\namounts of milk (2-4 oz or 60-120 ml, especially with food) can generally be tolerated by these persons.\\n\\nHowever, certain populations of North European ancestry and a few in Africa have genes causing lactase to remain with no symptoms of lactose intolerance.\\n\\nAdditional resources: NIH Medline Encyclopedia, carbohydrate Harvard Hospital nutrition source, carbohydrates Harvard Hospital nutrition source, fiber National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney diseases (NIDDK), NIH, lactose intolerance\\n\\n3\\n\\nWhat are fats?\\n\\nFats\\n\\nFats are mostly made of carbon and hydrogen and do not mix well with water. Most dietary fats, called triglycerides, are made with three fatty acids. Fatty acids can be saturated (full of hydrogen), monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated, depending on how much hydrogen can be added to them. Saturated fats provide concentrated energy, tend to be solid (e.g., in butter and lard), and promote high blood cholesterol. Monounsaturated fats are a healthy form of concentrated energy (e.g., in olive, canola, and peanut oils) and are less likely to spoil than polyunsaturated fats. Certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the diet are essential to good health and cannot be made by humans. ― The omega-3 fatty acid (ω-3) family includes\\n\\nALA (α-linolenic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). \\uf0a7 Rich vegetable oil sources are flax and canola. Fish oil (e.g., salmon) is rich in EPA and DHA.\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Omega-3 refers to the last opening for\\n\\nhydrogen being 3 positions from the end of the fat molecule.\\n\\n― The omega-6 fatty acid (ω-6) family includes\\n\\nLA (linoleic acid) and AA (ARA or arachidonic acid). \\uf0a7 Rich sources include corn, peanut,\\n\\nsesame, sunflower, and safflower oils. \\uf0a7 Omega-6 refers to the last opening for\\n\\nhydrogen being 6 positions from the end of the fat molecule\\n\\n― The best ratios of the two essential fatty acid\\n\\nfamilies are in soy oil and canola oil. \\uf0a7 There is also a good ratio in the less\\n\\ncommon hemp seed, mustard, and rice bran oils.\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Olive oil has a good ratio, but levels of\\n\\nthe essential fatty acids are low. ― Tropical oils (e.g., coconut oil and palm oil)\\n\\nare low in essential fatty acids. \\uf0a7 Their fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen but remain fluid at room temperature.\\n\\nTrans fatty acids are formed when hydrogen is added to unsaturated fats to make them solid. Cholesterol is another type of fat found in all cell membranes in small amounts.\\n\\nWhy are fats important?\\n\\nCell membranes are layers of fat which form cell walls and chambers. ― They keep fluids separate for chemical\\n\\nreactions characteristic of life and require essential fatty acids to function normally.\\n\\nFat is important insulation. ― Fat just below skin insulates the body from\\n\\nextreme temperatures.\\n\\n― Layers of fat around important organs\\n\\ninsulate them from physical shock or injury.\\n\\n― A special fat forms the layer around nerve cells that “electrically” insulates them from each other. Multiple sclerosis is an example of a condition where this layer is damaged.\\n\\nFat is an efficient way to store energy. ― A pound of fat contains about 3500 calories. ― Fats contain 9 calories in each gram compared to 4 for proteins and carbohydrates.\\n\\n― If energy were stored as carbohydrates\\n\\ninstead of fats, then body weight could be 30% greater.\\n\\nCholesterol performs several functions. ― It stabilizes cell membranes. ― It is the basis for some hormones (e.g.,\\n\\nhydrocortisone, estrogen, and testosterone) and for the production of vitamin D by sunlight on skin.\\n\\n― It is the basis for bile salts which help\\n\\ndigestion of fat.\\n\\nHowever, excess cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats in the diet can increase bad cholesterol in blood and worsen atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) and associated diseases. Decreasing these fats or replacing them with monounsaturated fats can help reduce these effects.\\n\\nAdditional resources: Harvard Hospital nutrition source, fats NIH Medline Encyclopedia, fats\\n\\n4\\n\\nMinerals\\n\\nMacrominerals – minerals required in large amounts in the diet.\\n\\nOver 200 mg of each macromineral is in a normal\\n\\ndaily diet.\\n\\nElectrolytes include sodium, potassium, and\\n\\nchloride. Generally, they are adequate in the diet. They can become unbalanced if dehydration\\n\\noccurs\\n\\nFruits, vegetables, and meats are good sources\\n\\nof electrolytes.\\n\\nCalcium – The most abundant mineral in the body.\\n\\n99% of the body’s calcium is combined with phosphorus in the skeleton to make bones strong.\\n\\n1% of the body’s calcium is in various body and\\n\\ntissue fluids\\n\\n\\uf0a7 This calcium is important for muscle tone,\\n\\nmuscle contraction, and nervous system functions.\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Muscle cramping may be an early symptom of\\n\\nlow blood calcium.\\n\\nExcellent diet sources include milk, yogurt, cheese, sardines, tofu, soy milk, and canned salmon (with bones). \\uf0a7 If foods like these are not eaten, then a calcium supplement should be considered with meals and green leafy vegetables included in the diet, particularly for women.\\n\\nInadequate intake of calcium leads to early osteoporosis and complicating fractures. Most bone calcium content accumulates by the end of adolescence and completes by about age 30. After that, skeletal calcium tends to decrease, especially in women after menopause. It is particularly critical for young women to maximize their bone mineral content before childbearing begins and to pay serious attention to calcium and vitamin D intake throughout their lives.\\n\\nOffice of Dietary Supplements, NIH, calcium Harvard University nutrition source, calcium\\n\\nPhosphorus\\n\\nPhosphorus combines with calcium to strengthen the skeleton. It participates in numerous chemical reactions in the body. It also forms part of the nucleic acid strands that make up genes. Most normal diets have enough phosphorus, so diet deficiency is very rare. Certain diseases such\\n\\n5\\n\\nas kidney failure, however, can result in excessive loss of phosphorus, creating a deficiency in the body.\\n\\nNIH Medline Encyclopedia, phosphorus\\n\\nMagnesium\\n\\nAbout half of the body’s magnesium is found in the bones, half within cells, and about 1% in the blood and tissue fluids. It is important for normal muscle and nerve functions, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood-sugar levels and promotes normal blood pressure. Muscle cramping may be an early symptom of a deficiency. The best sources are leafy green vegetables, nuts, and seafood, although other good sources include whole grains, meats, and dairy products.\\n\\nOffice of Dietary Supplements, NIH, magnesium\\n\\nTrace elements or microminerals – minerals required in very small amounts in the diet.\\n\\nLess than 20 mg of each micromineral is in a\\n\\nnormal daily diet, but each is essential to life and health.\\n\\nMicrominerals are important helpers in various\\n\\nreactions throughout the body\\n\\nSome important microminerals are iron, iodine,\\n\\nzinc, copper, selenium, fluorine, and chromium.\\n\\nIron\\n\\nIron makes up a central part of hemoglobin in red blood cells. It carries life-giving oxygen throughout the body. Insufficient iron or copper are two causes of anemia (low red blood cell count), which results in paleness, fatigue, tiredness, and loss of energy. Menstruating women lose blood regularly and easily develop iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in the cells, even in the absence of anemia, also leads to tiredness, fatigue, and decreased energy. Good sources of iron include meat, fortified cereals, beans, green leafy vegetables, and whole grains. \\uf0a7 Human milk contains little iron.\\n\\no However, it is generally sufficient for the first\\n\\n6 months of life\\n\\no After that, the infant diet should include\\n\\nadditional sources of iron.\\n\\n\\uf0a7 If iron deficiency occurs, then a supplement is\\n\\nneeded.\\n\\nOffice of Dietary Supplements, NIH, iron\\n\\nIodine\\n\\nZinc\\n\\nIodine is part of thyroid hormones It is critical to human health and function. Deficiency leads to \\uf0a7 Goiters (swelling of the thyroid gland). \\uf0a7 Loss of energy, tiredness, and constipation. \\uf0a7 Mental function slowing down. \\uf0a7 Cretinism and permanent mental retardation in the child when severe deficiency occurs during pregnancy and infancy.\\n\\nSources of dietary iodine are quite variable, depending on the soil in which the food is produced. Seafood is often an excellent source but is also variable. Dairy products are good sources if the cows producing them eat grass and hay with good iodine content or are supplemented. The most reliable dietary source is iodized salt. It is suggested that iodized salt always be used even if it costs more than non-iodized salt.\\n\\nUniversity of Michigan, iodine deficiency\\n\\nZinc helps in many chemical reactions in the body. Deficiency leads to \\uf0a7 Skin rashes, dermatitis, hair loss, diarrhea,\\n\\npoor wound healing, and decreased immune function.\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Diminished eyesight, taste, smell, and memory. \\uf0a7 Delayed puberty. 25% of the people in the world are at risk for zinc deficiency, especially populations consuming plant-based diets low in available zinc or with diseases such as chronic diarrhea, which increase zinc losses or interferes with zinc absorption. Meats are a primary source of zinc but other sources include dairy products, beans, nuts, and fortified cereals. Absorption is best in diets that include animal proteins.\\n\\nOffice of Dietary Supplements, NIH, zinc\\n\\nVitamins\\n\\nVitamins are organic compounds essential to life and health though present in very small amounts.\\n\\nFat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D,\\n\\nvitamin E, and vitamin K):\\n\\nCan be stored in the body.

Generally does not cause allergies. Includes antibodies which may provide some protection against germs found in the environment of the mother and infant.\\n\\nThe carbohydrates (lactose) from mother’s milk: Are readily digestible by virtually all newborn infants. Provide a natural laxative function.\\n\\nThe fat provides infants with:\\n\\nEssential fatty acids. Energy to meet rapid growth needs.\\n\\nMinerals and vitamins are readily digestible and generally sufficient with modest exposure to sunlight to produce some vitamin D.\\n\\nHow should infants be fed?\\n\\nMother’s milk should be exclusively fed to an infant for the first 4 to 6 months and should be the foundation of a child’s diet for at least 12 months. By 4 to 6 months of age, infants tend to “outgrow” their body supply of iron, and other nutrients are needed in addition to mother’s milk.\\n\\nNew foods are often introduced one at a time for a week or more to determine that the infant tolerates it. Iron-fortified baby cereal (rice or oatmeal) mixed with a little breast milk is generally a good first solid food. This can be followed by pureed fruits, vegetables, and meats. \\uf0a7 Vegetables should be cooked and thoroughly\\n\\nmashed.\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Ripe fruits can be sanitized, peeled, and\\n\\npureed as well.\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Cooked meats should be chopped and\\n\\nminced to a fine paste.\\n\\n8\\n\\nIf baby cereal is not available, then gruel (made of rice or oatmeal) can be prepared. Baby foods should be prepared using purified water and containers which have been sanitized.\\n\\nHow do you feed an infant if the mother’s milk is not available, for example, when the mother is missing or very ill?\\n\\nA milk substitute may occasionally be used but will not have the advantages of mother’s milk and risks of infection may increase. The preferred substitute is an iron-fortified commercial infant formula prepared exactly as instructed on the label. Caution: Do not dilute with extra water.\\n\\nIn an emergency, when neither mother’s milk nor commercial formula is available, a temporary substitute can be prepared by mixing 19 fl. oz. (600 mL) whole cow milk, 13 fl. oz. (400 mL) water, and 3 tablespoons (45 mL) granulated sugar [or alternatively 10 fl. oz. (300 mL) evaporated milk, 22 fl. oz. (700 mL) water, and 3 tablespoons (45 mL) granulated sugar]. Bring just to a boil and let it cool to room temperature in a sterile container protected from dust and flies. Caution: Condensed milk, honey, molasses, and corn syrup sweetener should not be used, and goat milk requires a folic acid supplement.\\n\\nAdditional resource: American Academy of Pediatrics; infant nutrition\\n\\nDietary Supplements\\n\\nSupplements to a well-balanced diet are\\n\\ngenerally not necessary.\\n\\nExcess amounts of some supplements may create an unhealthy balance of nutrients.

They include anorexia nervosa, bulimia\\n\\nnervosa, and binge eating. ― Anorexia nervosa is characterized as\\n\\nbecoming too thin (see malnutrition) when persons do not eat enough because they think they are fat.\\n\\n― Bulimia nervosa involves periods of\\n\\novereating followed by purging, sometimes through self-induced vomiting or using laxatives.\\n\\n― Binge eating is out-of-control eating, often to the point of being uncomfortable. It is similar to bulimia but without purging. Compulsive overeating has been classified as a separate eating disorder by some and included with binge eating by others. It has been called an addiction to food. Persons with compulsive overeating use food to cope with their feelings, which leads to obesity. Like those who suffer from binge eating, compulsive overeaters are at risk of heart attack, high blood-pressure, high\\n\\ncholesterol, kidney disease and/or failure, arthritis and bone deterioration, and stroke.\\n\\nWho gets eating disorders?\\n\\nWomen are more likely than men to have eating\\n\\ndisorders.\\n\\nThey usually start in the teenage years and often occur along with depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. How are eating disorders managed?\\n\\nA qualified health professional should assist\\n\\nwith diagnosis and management.\\n\\nEating disorders can cause heart and kidney\\n\\nproblems and even death. Getting help early is important.\\n\\nTreatment involves monitoring, mental health\\n\\ntherapy, nutritional counseling, and sometimes medicines.\\n\\nAdditional resources: National Library of Medicine, NIH; eating disorders National Institute of Mental Health, NIH; eating disorders National Eating Disorders Association Something Fishy - website on eating disorders\\n\\nWhy is it not good to be overweight?\\n\\nObesity\\n\\nExcess weight interferes with health, well-being, and the ability to perform normal daily activities. ― Some immediate problems of excess weight\\n\\nObesity ― Body mass index is between 30 and 40. ― Normal body function is compromised because\\n\\ninclude decreased mobility, fatigue, tiredness, shortness of breath with exercise, increased sweating, back pain, and lower limb problems with feet, ankles, knees, and/or hips.\\n\\n― Longer-term excess weight includes increased\\n\\nsusceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. ― The normal body mass index (BMI) is between 18.5 and 25, although up to 28 is acceptable for persons over age 50. See Nutrition Calculations, BMI to calculate your body mass index.\\n\\n― Waist size measured at the navel line has also been shown to be an indicator of health risks due to obesity, regardless of actual weight. Risks are increased in adult women with a waist size greater than 35 inches (89 cm) and in adult men with a waist size greater than 40 inches (102 cm).\\n\\n― It is best to begin early to control a tendency to\\n\\nbe overweight.\\n\\n12\\n\\nof excess weight.\\n\\n― Obesity should be treated vigorously when\\n\\nevident. Morbid obesity ― Body mass index is 40 or more. ― Both body functions and health are impaired. ― Aggressive action may be required to correct\\n\\nit.\\n\\n― Weight loss surgery may be necessary if life is\\n\\nin jeopardy.\\n\\nWhat causes obesity?\\n\\nMost commonly, obesity is due to eating more calories (energy) than used for activity and maintenance.\\n\\nOccasionally, hormonal imbalances such as\\n\\nhypothyroidism or excessive hydrocortisone can help cause obesity.\\n\\nHow can weight be managed?\\n\\nAt least 30 minutes of daily exercise for six days\\n\\neach week is normally recommended.\\n\\n― An additional 30 minutes of daily activity would\\n\\nbe wise.\\n\\n― A good goal is to walk or run five miles a day. A carefully selected diet is important to\\n\\nsuccessfully manage excessive weight.\\n\\n― A diet low in animal fat will help. ― The diet should be modified to maintain\\n\\nappropriate nutrition while decreasing calorie intake.\\n\\n― A daily multiple vitamin and mineral\\n\\nsupplement is recommended.\\n\\nDesign a weight-reduction diet such as the\\n\\nfollowing:\\n\\n― Determine the estimated number of calories estimated to be needed to maintain weight based on gender, age, height, weight, and activity level. See Nutrition Calculations, Estimate Daily Calories.\\n\\n― Choose an intake of 500-1000 calories LESS\\n\\nthan the one estimated to maintain your\\n\\ncurrent weight (but not less than a total of 1000 calories per day).\\n\\n― Use your chosen daily calorie intake to\\n\\ndetermine the servings in each food group. See Nutrition Calculations, balanced diet servings.\\n\\n― Distribute these servings over 5 to 6 meals\\n\\nthroughout waking hours.\\n\\nUse low-calorie snacks to stave off hunger, such as yogurt (80-100 calories) plus a glass of water.\\n\\nStrictly maintain the size and number of servings\\n\\neach day.\\n\\nConsider and treat edema and hormonal\\n\\nimbalances, if present.

A higher number means more fat and a lower means less fat. The range for good health is between 18.5 and 25; up to 28 is acceptable if over age 50. Obesity is from 30 to 40 and morbid obesity is over 40. Severe malnutrition is 17.5 and lower.\\n\\nWhat impacts daily calorie needs and how are they estimated?\\n\\nIn addition to weight and height, the calories needed to maintain that weight depend upon gender, age, and activity. Activity is estimated from the number of minutes spent exercising each day, including walking. The estimator on the right or in Appendix B applies only to persons age 3 and older. You can also use the estimator as a guide to lose or gain weight. Use your target weight to estimate your target calories needed. To lose weight, choose a level below or equal to your target calories but no less than 1000 calories per day unless otherwise directed by your physician. To gain weight, choose a level above or equal to your target calories.\\n\\nHow is the number of servings in each food group determined for a balanced diet at a particular calorie intake?\\n\\nA balanced diet includes servings from each food group during each day. Use the calculator on the right or the table below to convert any calorie goal between 1000 and 9800 into the number of servings needed from each food group each day. The number of calories entered will be rounded to the nearest 200 to generate the list of servings. Whole grains should make up half of the servings of grains. A variety of fruits and vegetables of different bright colors will provide needed vitamins and minerals. Oil should include vegetable oils containing essential fatty acids to be used in food dressings and cooking. If meat is not lean and/or dairy is not reduced fat, then the servings of extra calories should be reduced. The size of each serving is critical in determining the total number of calories consumed each day. See the following table that shows the relatively modest size of the servings compared to what may be customary.\\n\\nCategory\\n\\nServing Sizes\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nGrains\\n\\n1 oz or 30 g\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n½ cup or 120 mL\\n\\nFruits\\n\\n½ cup or 120 mL\\n\\nDairy (milk group)\\n\\n1 cup or 240 mL 2 oz or 60 g\\n\\nMeat & beans\\n\\n3 oz or 90 g\\n\\n1 slice bread, ½ cup or 125 mL cooked rice tennis ball-sized serving tennis ball-sized serving or medium-sized piece of fruit (apple, orange, peach) or ½ cup of juice\\n\\n1 cup low-fat milk or yogurt 2 dominoes-sized pieces of cheese card deck-sized piece of lean meat, ½ cup beans, checkbook-sized piece of fish\\n\\nVegetable oil\\n\\n1 tablespoon or 15 mL\\n\\nExtra calories\\n\\n120 calories\\n\\nin cooking, gravies, or dressings small piece of cake, ½ candy bar, 2 golf ball-sized scoops of ice cream\\n\\n14\\n\\nSUGGESTED SERVINGS FOR DIFFERENT TOTAL DAILY CALORIES\\n\\nTo estimate servings for higher intakes, multiply 3200 calorie column numbers by chosen calorie factor (e.g., 3500/3200)\\n\\nTOTAL CALORIES\\n\\n1000\\n\\n1200\\n\\n1400\\n\\n1600\\n\\n1800\\n\\n2000\\n\\n2200\\n\\n2400\\n\\n2600\\n\\n2800\\n\\n3000\\n\\n3200\\n\\nGrains\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nDairy\\n\\nMeat & beans\\n\\nVegetable Oil\\n\\nExtra Calories\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n7\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n8\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n9\\n\\n7\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n7\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n8\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n3\\n\\n4.5\\n\\n8\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n3\\n\\n5\\n\\nAdditional resources: U.S. Department of Agriculture; Food Pyramid U.S. Department of Agriculture; Dietary Guidelines California State University; Composition of common foods U.S. Department of Agriculture; Comprehensive source of food composition American Heart Association; food portion control American Cancer Society; food portion control\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\nAppendix A\\n\\nBody Mass Index (BMI) The BMI has been used as a measure of the appropriateness of a person’s weight for a given height.

Important factors to consider are gender, weight (pounds or kilograms), height (inches or meters), level of activity, and age (years).

But it will make the water clear before you purify it. Filtering also makes the water taste better. Algae and other particles are removed by passing the water through fine sand. Flavors and colors are removed by passing the water through crushed charcoal. Eventually, the fine sand will get clogged, and the charcoal will not filter well. Both will need to be replaced. Usually, a filter like the one shown in the diagram will work well for two months. It will filter 40 liters of water a day. When the water starts flowing too slowly, replace the top layer of fine sand. If the water still has an odor, color, or taste after it has been filtered, replace the charcoal.\\n\\nBuilding a Home Water Filter\\n\\nThis simple filter is made of two clean plastic containers such as buckets or trash cans. One should be smaller so that it will fit inside the larger container with at least 2½ centimeters of space around the outer edge.\\n\\n1. Study the picture of the filter.\\n\\n2. Punch or drill holes in the bottom of the smaller container. They should be at least ½ centimeter in diameter so that the water can flow freely from the inner to the outer container.\\n\\n3. You may want to use a faucet or spigot to draw off the filtered water. If you do, drill or punch a hole in the side of the outer container. The hole should be a little above where the sand and charcoal will be. Install the faucet with rubber or plastic washers or plastic gasket cement.\\n\\n4. Place gravel in the bottom of the large container. Put in enough so that the top of the inner container will be even with the top of the larger container.\\n\\n5. Put the smaller container on the gravel. Fill it about half full with fine sand. Cover the sand with about five centimeters of gravel to hold the sand in place when you pour water into the filter.\\n\\n6. Fill the lower portion of the space between the containers with crushed charcoal. Cover it with about five centimeters of sand to keep charcoal particles from floating to the surface.\\n\\nUsing the Water Filter\\n\\nClean the filter before you use it. Pour water into the smaller container and draw it off with the faucet until the water comes out clear. Then run eight liters of water that has two teaspoons of chlorine bleach in it through the filter. Then run eight liters of water without chlorine bleach through the filter. The filter is now ready for regular use.\\n\\nAdd water here\\n\\nSmall brass or plastic faucet\\n\\nSand prevents charcoal from floating\\n\\nGravel holds sand while water is poured\\n\\nFine sand\\n\\nCrushed charcoal in space between containers\\n\\nGravel supports inner container\\n\\nHoles at least ½ centimeter in diameter permit water flow from inner to outer container 20', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Nutrition_and_Diet.pdf'})]"

This questionnaire gives a basic indication of caloric and nutritional intake by each crewmember. In special cases where exact food consumption data is required for a scientific experiment, the astronauts would use a bar code reader and scan the bar code on each package of food consumed.

              " Document(page_content='1. Proteins What are they? Chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks for all body tissues. The body needs 20 amino acids. The body can manufacture eleven of them, but the other nine, called essential amino acids, must come from food. Where do they come from? Animal sources of proteins such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs and milk contain all of the essential amino acids and are called complete proteins. Plant proteins are found in legumes (beans), nuts, and seeds. They are called incomplete proteins because they do not contain all of the essential amino acids. Some may be combined to form complete proteins, for example, rice and beans. How does the body use them? The body uses proteins mainly for building and maintaining all its tissues. Throughout life new proteins form constantly to replace damaged or worn-out body cells. What happens if we don’t get enough? Kwashiorkor is a condition resulting from inadequate protein intake. Early symptoms include fatigue, irritability, and lethargy. As protein deprivation continues, one sees growth failure, loss of muscle mass, generalized swelling (edema), and decreased immunity. A large, protuberant belly is common. The incidence of kwashiorkor in children in the U.S. is extremely small and it is typically found in countries where there is drought and famine. 2. Fats What are they? Fats are compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They come in several forms depending on how they are put together; saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and Trans fats. Where do they come from? Almost all of the food we eat contains some fat. It can be found in meats, milk and milk products like cheese, butter, and ice cream, vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, and foods that are fried or prepared with sauces. How does the body use them? Fat provides our most concentrated form of energy and is used to build our own body’s fats. In the body, fats carry vitamins in the bloodstream and builds cells. Body fat serves as a source of stored energy, cushions organs, and acts as insulation. Most of the fats our body needs can be made from carbohydrates, but there are three essential fatty acids that the body can’t make on its own. These need to come from foods that we eat. What happens if we don’t get enough? A deficiency of certain fats has been linked to neurological disorders such as ADD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression. 3. Carbohydrates What are they? Carbohydrates are molecules made up of carbon and water. They come in three forms: sugars, starches, and fiber.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Introduction_to_Nutrition.pdf'}),\n",

Eventually, the body enters a state of semi-starvation. This condition is known as marasmus . 4. Water What is it? A compound of hydrogen and oxygen that is liquid at temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius. An extraordinary property of water is its ability to dissolve other substances. Were it not for the solvent property of water, life could not exist because water transfers nutrients vital to life in animals and plants. Where does it come from? The most important source is drinking water. It is also in other fluids we drink. Fruits and vegetables have high water content. Most other foods contain some water. How does the body use it? Water is vital to every function in the body; about two-thirds of the body is water. It is the main component of blood and carries nutrients to your cells and carries away waste products. It also lubricates joints and mucous membranes, allows you to swallow and digest food, and regulates body temperature through perspiration. What happens if we don’t get enough? Dehydration is a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough water. Persistent fatigue, lethargy, muscle weakness or cramps, headaches, dizziness, nausea, forgetfulness, confusion, deep rapid breathing, or an increased heart rate characterizes dehydration. Dehydration is a very serious; it can quickly cause severe problems and even death.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Introduction_to_Nutrition.pdf'}),\n",

However, it is important to note that iodine is not found in sea salts, gourmet salts, or other salty foods. One half-teaspoon of iodized salt provides the daily recommended 150-µg dose. Also, iodine levels in sea vegetables fluctuate dramatically, with some (especially dulse and nori) contain- ing safe amounts and others (such as kelp) harboring toxic doses. Hijiki, also spelled hiziki, should be avoided owing to its ex- cessive arsenic levels. A preexisting iodine deficiency, a selenium deficiency, or high intake of goitrogens (antinutrients found in cruciferous vegetables, soy products, flaxseeds, millet, peanuts, peaches, pears, pine nuts, spinach, sweet potatoes, and strawberries) can interfere with iodine absorption.

As we age, the body naturally ages along with us and systems that once worked so well when we were younger may encounter difficulties sustaining their vital functions at or near previous levels. Many of these things that affect the efficiency of our bodily functions are caused by us and the 2 biggest culprits are nutrition and fitness. The following is a very surface explanation of some of the most basic concepts of nutrition.\\n\\nMarco nutrients:\\n\\nCarbohydrates: There are 2 types of carbohydrates and 3 if you include fiber;\\n\\nhowever, since fiber contributes no actual nutrients, it is included for personal understanding.

Therefore, no 2 people will experience food or its’ benefits and hazards in the same exact way. Some people can drink milk all day long with no adverse effects, while others will experience severe reactions to the sugar in milk. Some children can eat peanut butter every day, while another child can die from an extreme allergic reaction.

Without getting technical, it is the simple carbohydrates that provide energy and cause a multitude of health problems.

They are 1 or 2 sugars combined chemically that are instantly metabolized and very quickly enter the blood stream as glucose( blood sugar). Simple carbs begin their metabolic breakdown in the mouth and by the time they reach the small intestine they are completely broken down and instantly are injected into the blood stream. Although, glucose is essential to create cellular energy, the constant bombardment of glucose, unrestrictedly, causes the pancreas to secret insulin repeatedly over and over throughout the day. Since simple carbohydrates are an instant form of energy, they get absorbed instantly and used up just as quickly, making us hungry very shortly afterwards. Because we use the energy so quickly and get hungry so quickly afterwards, we enter into a vicious cycle of sugar highs and sugar lows that is repeated over and over. As a result of this sugar cycling, the pancreas is required to release more and more insulin every time to facilitate glucose’s entry into the cells for energy. Over time, the pancreas as you would expect gets over worked and over tired, resulting in a condition known as insulin resistance, which is a pre cursor for diabetes type 2. When this occurs, the mechanisms that allow glucose to enter into the cells, begins to mal function and the sugar is denied access to the cells and re-enters the blood stream. Only this time, the insulin takes the excess glucose which has nowhere to go and converts the excess sugar in fat cells, usually being deposited in the belly as “ belly fat”. Unless this cycle is stopped by changes in your diet, the sequence will be constantly repeated and fat has NO limitations as to how much it can grow and influence other cells to help it grow by sending it more and more fat.

This becomes highly toxic because microscopic bacteria that should be dealt with in the metabolic process, enters the blood stream through tiny pockets created in the intestine from the excess acids.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Basic_Nutrition_101.pdf'}),\n",

Fiber is essential to keeping out entire GI tract healthy and it also makes the stomach feel fuller and causes the breakdown of carbs into glucose to take much longer. The result is you do not get as hungry as quickly and when you do eat the release of sugar and insulin does not result in glucose- insulin rushes.\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF SIMPLE CARBOHYDRATES:\\n\\nPizza\\n\\nAll processed foods - - White bread - White flour - Candy - - - Breakfast cereals almost exclusively -\\n\\nSoda Fruit juices\\n\\nSports drinks\\n\\nEXAMPLES OF COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES:', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Basic_Nutrition_101.pdf'}),\n",

So when looking to include protein in the diet it is always preferable to select protein that is lean and organic, and has as little fat as possible. The fat that accompanies protein is also generally saturated fat and should be limited to small amounts each day. Protein can be used in a pinch to supply energy to cells, but it is not its’ primary function.

Obviously, the higher the caloric number, the more potential energy it provides. The important thing to understand about calories is whether that food product, yielding that amount of energy, is nutrient dense or nutrient empty, or “empty calories” When a food is nutrient dense, it means that the food yielding that energy, provides a lot of energy with a low caloric intake. For example, a box of raisins contains approximately 250 calories, and you know how quickly you can down that box and even look for another box or additional food. The box of raisins is nutrient empty when compared to 4 cups of grapes which yields about 287 calories. Low calories combined with a higher energy volume equals nutrient dense.

            "Summary: Dietary fiber (in Commonwealth English fibre) or roughage is the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely broken down by human digestive enzymes. Dietary fibers are diverse in chemical composition, and can be grouped generally by their solubility, viscosity, and fermentability, which affect how fibers are processed in the body. Dietary fiber has two main components: soluble fiber and insoluble fiber, which are components of plant-based foods, such as legumes, whole grains and cereals, vegetables, fruits, and nuts or seeds. A diet high in regular fiber consumption is generally associated with supporting health and lowering the risk of several diseases. Dietary fiber consists of non-starch polysaccharides and other plant components such as cellulose, resistant starch, resistant dextrins, inulin, lignins, chitins (in fungi), pectins, beta-glucans, and oligosaccharides.Food sources of dietary fiber have traditionally been divided according to whether they provide soluble or insoluble fiber. Plant foods contain both types of fiber in varying amounts, according to the fiber characteristics of viscosity and fermentability. Advantages of consuming fiber depend upon which type of fiber is consumed and which benefits may result in the gastrointestinal system. Bulking fibers – such as cellulose and hemicellulose (including psyllium) – absorb and hold water, promoting regularity. Viscous fibers – such as beta-glucan and psyllium – thicken the fecal mass. Fermentable fibers – such as resistant starch, xanthan gum, and inulin – feed the bacteria and microbiota of the large intestine, and are metabolized to yield short-chain fatty acids, which have diverse roles in gastrointestinal health.Soluble fiber (fermentable fiber or prebiotic fiber) – which dissolves in water – is generally fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically active by-products, such as short-chain fatty acids produced in the colon by gut bacteria. Examples are beta-glucans (in oats, barley, and mushrooms) and raw guar gum. Psyllium – a soluble, viscous, nonfermented fiber – is a bulking fiber that retains water as it moves through the digestive system, easing defecation. Soluble fiber is generally viscous and delays gastric emptying which, in humans, can result in an extended feeling of fullness. Inulin (in chicory root), wheat dextrin, oligosaccharides, and resistant starches (in legumes and bananas), are soluble non-viscous fibers. Regular intake of soluble fibers, such as beta-glucans from oats or barley, has been established to lower blood levels of LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.Insoluble fiber – which does not dissolve in water – is inert to digestive enzymes in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Examples are wheat bran, cellulose, and lignin. Coarsely ground insoluble fiber triggers the secretion of mucus in the large intestine, providing bulking. Finely ground insoluble fiber does not have this effect and can actually have a constipating effect. Some forms of insoluble fiber, such as resistant starches, can be fermented in the colon.\n",

            "Summary: A low-residue diet is a diet intended to reduce certain constituents of the bowel, often with consequence for functional behaviour of the bowel. It may be prescribed for patients with ailments or functional gastrointestinal disorders mitigated by fewer and smaller bowel movements each day. \n",
            "The diet may be used as part of the bowel preparation before a diagnostic procedure such as colonoscopy or as a short-term therapy for acute stages of gastrointestinal illnesses such as Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, and ulcerative colitis.

The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.\n",
            "The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6.\n",
            "The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) for 2020 was 41 million tonnes, with over 44% of the world total grown in China. Carrots are commonly consumed raw or cooked in various cuisines.\n",

Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy.\n",
            "Complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from protein and essential fatty acids from fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate, protein, and fat.

Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Symptoms of anemia depend on how quickly hemoglobin decreases. Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause. Preoperative anemia can increase the risk of needing a blood transfusion following surgery. Anemia can be temporary or long term and can range from mild to severe.Anemia can be caused by blood loss, decreased red blood cell production, and increased red blood cell breakdown. Causes of bleeding include bleeding due to inflammation of the stomach or intestines, bleeding from surgery, serious injury, or blood donation. Causes of decreased production include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, thalassemia and a number of bone marrow tumors. Causes of increased breakdown include genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia, infections such as malaria, and certain autoimmune diseases. Anemia can also be classified based on the size of the red blood cells and amount of hemoglobin in each cell. If the cells are small, it is called microcytic anemia; if they are large, it is called macrocytic anemia; and if they are normal sized, it is called normocytic anemia. The diagnosis of anemia in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL); in women, it is less than 120 to 130 g/L (12 to 13 g/dL). Further testing is then required to determine the cause.A large number of patients diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease present with no active inflammation or dietary issues. These include many with reduced limb loading, such as spinal cord injured patients, astronauts, elderly people with limited mobility, bed-bound and experimental bed-rest subjects.Certain groups of individuals, such as pregnant women, benefit from the use of iron pills for prevention. Dietary supplementation, without determining the specific cause, is not recommended. The use of blood transfusions is typically based on a person's signs and symptoms. In those without symptoms, they are not recommended unless hemoglobin levels are less than 60 to 80 g/L (6 to 8 g/dL). These recommendations may also apply to some people with acute bleeding. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are only recommended in those with severe anemia.Anemia is the most common blood disorder, affecting about a third of the global population. Iron-deficiency anemia affects nearly 1 billion people. In 2013, anemia due to iron deficiency resulted in about 183,000 deaths – down from 213,000 deaths in 1990. This condition is most prevalent in children with also an above average prevalence in elderly and women of reproductive age (especially during pregnancy).Anemia is one of the six WHO global nutrition targets for 2025 and for diet-related global targets endorsed by World Health Assembly in 2012 and 2013. Efforts to reach global targets contribute to reaching Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with anemia as one of the targets in SDG 2 for achieving zero world hunger.\n",

When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague such as feeling tired, weak, short of breath, or having decreased ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has more severe symptoms, including confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out or increased thirst. Anemia is typically significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Children with iron deficiency anemia may have problems with growth and development. There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause.Iron-deficiency anemia is caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding. Poor absorption of iron from food may occur as a result of an intestinal disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, or surgery such as a gastric bypass. In the developing world, parasitic worms, malaria, and HIV/AIDS increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia. Diagnosis is confirmed by blood tests.Iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by eating a diet containing sufficient amounts of iron or by iron supplementation. Foods high in iron include meat, nuts, and foods made with iron-fortified flour. Treatment may include dietary changes and dealing with underlying causes, for example medical treatment for parasites or surgery for ulcers. Iron supplements and vitamin C may be recommended. Severe cases may be treated with blood transfusions or iron injections.Iron-deficiency anemia affected about 1.48 billion people in 2015. A lack of dietary iron is estimated to cause approximately half of all anemia cases globally. Women and young children are most commonly affected. In 2015, anemia due to iron deficiency resulted in about 54,000 deaths – down from 213,000 deaths in 1990.\n",

            "Summary: Iron deficiency, or sideropenia, is the state in which a body lacks enough iron to supply its needs. Iron is present in all cells in the human body and has several vital functions, such as carrying oxygen to the tissues from the lungs as a key component of the hemoglobin protein, acting as a transport medium for electrons within the cells in the form of cytochromes, and facilitating oxygen enzyme reactions in various tissues. Too little iron can interfere with these vital functions and lead to morbidity and death.Total body iron averages approximately 3.8 g in men and 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein transferrin. There are several mechanisms that control iron metabolism and safeguard against iron deficiency. The main regulatory mechanism is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. The majority of iron absorption occurs in the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. A number of dietary factors may affect iron absorption. When loss of iron is not sufficiently compensated by intake of iron from the diet, a state of iron deficiency develops over time. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to iron-deficiency anemia, a common type of anemia. Before anemia occurs, the medical condition of iron deficiency without anemia is called latent iron deficiency (LID).\n",

Iron is both necessary to the body and potentially toxic. Controlling iron levels in the body is a critically important part of many aspects of human health and disease. Hematologists have been especially interested in systemic iron metabolism, because iron is essential for red blood cells, where most of the human body's iron is contained. Understanding iron metabolism is also important for understanding diseases of iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, and iron deficiency, such as iron-deficiency anemia.\n",

            "Page: Iron\n",
            "Summary: Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe (from Latin  ferrum 'iron') and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, just ahead of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state, with its ores also being found there.\n",
            "Extracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) or higher, about 500 °C (932 °F) higher than that required to smelt copper. Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BCE and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys—in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.\n",
            "Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. High-purity irons (e.g. electrolytic iron) are more resistant to corrosion.\n",
            "The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism, respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\n",

            "Summary: Iron-deficiency anemia is anemia caused by a lack of iron. Anemia is defined as a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague such as feeling tired, weak, short of breath, or having decreased ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has more severe symptoms, including confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out or increased thirst. Anemia is typically significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Children with iron deficiency anemia may have problems with growth and development. There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause.Iron-deficiency anemia is caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding. Poor absorption of iron from food may occur as a result of an intestinal disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, or surgery such as a gastric bypass. In the developing world, parasitic worms, malaria, and HIV/AIDS increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia. Diagnosis is confirmed by blood tests.Iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by eating a diet containing sufficient amounts of iron or by iron supplementation. Foods high in iron include meat, nuts, and foods made with iron-fortified flour. Treatment may include dietary changes and dealing with underlying causes, for example medical treatment for parasites\u001b[0m\n",
