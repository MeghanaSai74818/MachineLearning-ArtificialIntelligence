## Comparative Study of CNN Architectures

- Description: In this study, I have conducted exploratory data analysis on image datasets including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100. By applying techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, I have analyzed the complexity and visualized these datasets in a reduced dimensionality space. Additionally, I have implemented popular convolutional neural network architectures, namely AlexNet, VGG-13, ResNet-18, and ResNet-34, for image classification. By evaluating their performances on standardized datasets with common hyperparameters, I have compared the efficacy of these models. The projects in this repository showcase my expertise in exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and image classification using deep learning architectures.

## Customer Segmentation

- Description: In this project, I performed clustering on the Credit Card Dataset using the K-means algorithm. By grouping customers into clusters based on their similarities, I aimed to identify distinct segments within the dataset. After clustering, I applied the ID3 decision tree algorithm to build a classification model and evaluated its performance on the resulting customer clusters. The model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to assess its effectiveness in classifying the clusters. By combining clustering and classification techniques, this project aimed to gain insights into customer segmentation and evaluate the clustering solution using the ID3 model.
